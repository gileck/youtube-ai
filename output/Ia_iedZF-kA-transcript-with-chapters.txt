do you like water you know water makes
up 71
of the earth&amp;#39;s surface 60 of our bodies
main ingredient in
swimming chirping ice skating water polo
skiing making ice cubes if you consider
that an activity but
do you understand water
i understand water why does it form
spherical drops
what is surface tension and how does it
work how come it gets sucked up
a paper towel huh like what&amp;#39;s the deal
with that why does it dribble down the
glass
do you know what cohesion means
what about adhesion capillary action
the meniscus effect no well by the end
of this video you&amp;#39;ll be able to answer
all of those questions welcome to the
physics
of water we need a big title and
grand music physics of water like
there&amp;#39;s an entire
army marching fields of water
no we shouldn&amp;#39;t get i shouldn&amp;#39;t sing i
would you know why we should do this
without me singing
everything you need to know about water
starts with one simple idea
water is magnets water
is magnets magnets
water is magnets water is met no water
are magnets water molecules act like
magnets no no we&amp;#39;re going to stick with
water as magnets i know i know
it&amp;#39;s kind of bad grammar but it&amp;#39;s good
science and what does that mean
well let me explain water is just
two elements three atoms one
oxygen and two hydrogen and it looks
just like this
well not just like this i mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
smaller
and you know not color-coded the oxygen
atom has a negative charge
and the hydrogen atoms have a positive
charge so just like a positive and
negative in a magnet
they attract each other oh my you are
very
attractive oh my stars you&amp;#39;re very
attractive too i&amp;#39;m very attracted to you
i&amp;#39;m very attracted to you too
all the molecules are attracted to each
other
this is called cohesion cohesion
oh no wait cohesion the molecules in the
middle are being attracted to all the
other molecules in
all other directions but on the outside
at the surface they are only being
pulled on one side
which means the surface of any bunch of
water molecules
are pulled in tighter than the ones on
the inside
they have more tension on the surface
surface
tension right think of it think of it
like the hard crust on a delicious pie
hard on the outside watery in the middle
yum the fact that they are all pulled
towards each other
is why you get spherical drops
the same way that gravity makes
spherical planets
and why bubbles are spherical spherical
spherical that&amp;#39;s a hard word to say we
should just call it
round roundios but that&amp;#39;s not all
because
water is magnets say it with me
water is magnets water is magnets water
is magnets
i&amp;#39;m by myself magnets are attracted to
things that are
ferromagnetic like metals with iron in
them
magnets are not attracted to things that
are not ferromagnetic
like wood
there it sticks it sticks
okay it didn&amp;#39;t stick water molecules are
also attracted to molecules on
other surfaces now magnets are attracted
to things that are ferromagnetic
what are water molecules attracted to
almost everything
water drops have weight they would be
pulled down by gravity if there wasn&amp;#39;t
another force
holding them up against things like like
your skin
or glass or metal wood paint pencils
fabric or you get the id just about just
about everything you throw water at
something
it&amp;#39;s most likely going to stick to the
side when water molecules stick to
things that aren&amp;#39;t water molecules
it&amp;#39;s called adhesion adhesion
cohesion adhesion water molecules
sticking to stuff check this out if you
look very closely
at a glass of water if you look at the
very edge
you&amp;#39;ll see that the water kind of climbs
the side of the glass a little bit
and this is because the water molecules
in the water are being pulled towards
all the other water molecules
but the water molecules at the very edge
are actually being pulled
a little bit toward the side of the
glass because they&amp;#39;re being attracted to
the glass
which means that they kind of stack up
on each other because they&amp;#39;re being
pulled that way
and that way which allows them to sort
of bunch up a bit
this is called the meniscus effect
meniscus effect meniscus meniscus
it&amp;#39;s not a good word meniscus they
should call it
climey bit on the side of a glass effect
long name sure but you know so why does
it do this
because water is magnets why does a
water drop
join up with another water drop water is
magnets water is magnets magnets go
go go there&amp;#39;s only one takeaway you
really need in this video and that&amp;#39;s
water as magnets i don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve
got that yet
and now that we know this meniscus
effect we know about capillary action
let me explain let&amp;#39;s say your container
is very narrow
like this one now you see the water
molecules are climbing the side of the
container
just like you know with the meniscus
effect but now they&amp;#39;re also climbing the
walls
of this side and then because the two
sides are so close together
the water molecules in the middle rise
up a bit which allows this side to climb
up a little bit more
and this side to climb up a little bit
more which makes the water molecules
rise up a little bit more and rise
um it&amp;#39;s capillary action
capillary action capillary action
all you got to do is remember that water
is magnets and you can figure out
all kinds of things like this experiment
you take a plastic rod
and you rub it in some cloth and then
you put it near some water and the water
gets pulled towards it
why well probably we can assume
that the rod has some sort of magnetic
charge that is attracting the water
because water is magnets magnets
magnets water
is magnets
let&amp;#39;s recap we should recap don&amp;#39;t you
think we should recap we should
definitely read that
why does water form a sphere water is
magnets
why does water have surface tension
water
is magnets water is magnets
why does it climb the side of the glass
water
is magnets and what&amp;#39;s this called
the meniscus effect and when it climbs
up a very narrow container
it&amp;#39;s called capillary action and now you
know
a lot more about water based on this one
idea water is
magnets

and
spread this video around like drops of
water being
flung at surfaces and they will stick to
those surfaces because water
is magnets
