# [02:28:40] Eucalyptus Oil, Inhalation

fever what about these cocktails that I see of eucalyptus oil oregano oil all this stuff is it completely worthless no it&amp;#39;s not completely worthless um so let&amp;#39;s look let&amp;#39;s talk about the science let&amp;#39;s talk about the um the actual data we don&amp;#39;t have I don&amp;#39;t have a randomized control trial to give you like I did with light but there was a study that was done and they the reason why they were looking at this was a bunch of oncologists that were looking to see if there was something that could improve the immune system when people were getting chemotherapy and they did an invitro study so this is in vitro but they were able to show that just a very small amount of eucalyptus oil had a tremendous impact on phagocytosis uh on the inate immune system they actually fyos folks sorry for interrupting but is a gobbling up of of yeah of bad stuff by good cells yeah exactly so they had these beads uh and you in the paper uh showed that these beads and they were fluorescent and you could see in the cells that had not yet gotten uh the eucalyptus oil that there was a number of beads outside and these cells were just kind of mosing around and uh they had both white microscopy and electron microscopy and a few few of these beads had gotten you know eaten up inside and then they showed the next slide it was like a transformation with the eucalyptus oil so the instead of these nice rounded cells they were like all of these things just coming out like like little poyes like reaching for things and then a few hours later it showed all of all of the beads that were outside were now inside so there was something in the eucalyptus oil itself that was stimulating the annate immune system to gobble this stuff up and again we go back to the folksy type of you know old stuff the main ingredient in vix Vapor Rub is eucalyptus oil could I have a theory yeah that um it&amp;#39;s not going to be uh very kind to eucalyptus trees or koalas or anything related to Eucalyptus which is that maybe the eucalyptus oil is a mild irritant yeah at the cellular level you inhale it you know you get this Menthol like or um uh odorant it&amp;#39;s kind of custic yeah and the immune system reacts to it by activating fago sites to go gobble up more stuff it could very well be um in that line of of discussion it I it&amp;#39;s very imperative to understand that eucalyptus oil is never recommended to be taken internally um there&amp;#39;s actually been reported deaths from taking too much eucalyptus oil so I just put that out there that people think that it&amp;#39;s going to work and more is better um usually the way it&amp;#39;s used and the way it has been used historically is and for instance in hydrotherapy they would put um maybe a few drops of that or rub it onto the skin and allow it to to sink and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s extremely potent if you if you go online to buy eucalyptus essential oil uh that should not really be taken internally it&amp;#39;s not designed for that um it&amp;#39;s extremely potent and um you know putting it maybe on your sometimes I&amp;#39;ll do that put it on the upper lip so I&amp;#39;m inhaling it um and actually can can be um actually very soothing in fact one of the things that I found very soothing and there are actually some data in the literature on this is if you get a cold and you&amp;#39;re congested is just U heating up some hot water on the stove putting a towel over your head and just inhaling that steam it tends to open things up and uh decrease the congestion and I&amp;#39;ve been known to put a couple of drops of eucalyptus oil into that and that&amp;#39;s actually been beneficial as well great don&amp;#39;t ingest eucalyptus oil folks I&amp;#39;ll uh take it as a personal insult but I&amp;#39;m not take a responsibility if you do it anyway yeah um that&amp;#39;s a great segue to
