# [03:05:04] Mold Toxicity, Lungs, Germ vs Terrain Theory, Immunocompromised

um given your expertise in lungs and uh a number of people I know have mold issues they claim or they believe that um mold has infiltrated their lungs um some doctors tell them they&amp;#39;re crazy some doctors tell them that they&amp;#39;re not crazy uh about that idea um is mold toxicity a real thing can it be treated maybe we do an entire episode about this another time but yeah uh is it a real thing and what is the kind of primary treatment for for mold toxicity it it is a real thing and mold is a is a substance that um can have multiple different effects on on the body let me give you an example um there&amp;#39;s a fungus called aspergillis and uh there&amp;#39;s two ways that aspergilus can affect the human body one is if it just sets up shop in your lungs and it doesn&amp;#39;t invade you could become allergic to it and so the symptoms are allergic actually there&amp;#39;s a condition called allergic Bronco pulmonary aspergillosis so it&amp;#39;s kind of like an autoimmune situation ex exactly and so you have you have symptoms of asthma you have symptoms of of of inability to breathe and the primary treatment ironic there is steroids because you need to reduce the inflammation but Al also antifungals to get rid of the thing that&amp;#39;s inciting in the first place that&amp;#39;s as opposed to invasive aspergillosis that&amp;#39;s where the fungus comes in and starts to invade and create a cavitary lesion usually with a fungus ball sitting in the middle of it oh yeah it&amp;#39;s pretty pretty bad sometimes it&amp;#39;s so bad that you actually have to do surgery to cut out that thing because you can&amp;#39;t cure it um the way that this often happens is mold and fungus is are in the air all the time so so here&amp;#39;s this this understanding of there&amp;#39;s germ Theory and there is terrain Theory and today and I I almost hate to even get into it but people think it&amp;#39;s one or the other and I can tell you as a physician it&amp;#39;s both there are certain diseases it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what your terrain is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to like neria menius if you get that it&amp;#39;s going to cause a bad menitis no matter how healthy you are okay there was just a I remember reading about a young um Japanese star I think or Taiwanese star just recently here that died of of influenza 48 years old no no medical problems so it&amp;#39;s possible no matter how good your terrain is you could get a bad bug a bad germ and it could kill you on the other hand there are certain bugs that are just sitting out there and they will go in and your immune system will just kick it out like it&amp;#39;s nothing why because your terrain is good because you so I can talk about like different types of infections that could do that so that&amp;#39;s where we are with molds so typically you&amp;#39;re breathing in all sorts of mold and fungus spores all the time but if your immune system is good it&amp;#39;ll just kick it out and it won&amp;#39;t have a chance to survive where you have a problem is if you have a situation where your immune system is compromised to give you an example of that practically there are some biological medications that people get when they have rheumatoid arthritis before we would if we get to that point where you have rheumatisms there&amp;#39;s an antib body there that&amp;#39;s suppressing the immune system so that you don&amp;#39;t have the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis that&amp;#39;s actually suppressing your immune system in those patients we&amp;#39;ll always check them for tuberculosis because certain people walking in the population will have an inactivated tuberculosis they&amp;#39;ve infected but their immune system has walled it off then we put put them on a biologic and the tuberculosis pops up so all of that to say that yes it is possible if you have mold in your house versus if you don&amp;#39;t have mold in your house that just increases the burden of mold that you&amp;#39;re inhaling and to the degree that it&amp;#39;s going to match against the uh your immune system you know that could depend on whether or not it jumps in and actually causes a problem so you know we&amp;#39;re coming up this is the time of year where we&amp;#39;re coming up to the Super Bowl so it&amp;#39;s the question about terrain Theory versus germ Theory and the question is is whoever wins the Super Bowl did did they win the Super bowl or did the other two lose the Super Bowl and that&amp;#39;s who knows so this is where this thing is it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not or it&amp;#39;s and and really what determines whether or not you get infected is how good is your immune system and how varent is the burden of of pathogen that&amp;#39;s going in the reason I asked is it a real thing is that people that I know who um believe they have a mold infection or they did do seem to have symptoms that last a long time yeah and there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any general agreement about what specific treatment to use for for this unless maybe they need surgery or something so do you give people antifungals um are there is there anything over the- counter that can help will the sauna protocols and steam protocols we were talking about earlier help I would imagine a lot of warm moist air is exactly what fungus loves yes uh it it does if if if someone came to me with mold uh with a mold complaint thinking they had mold um there are a number of tests that you can do to see whether or not there&amp;#39;s antibodies to those things and you can see whether or not that may or may not be there it&amp;#39;s not definitive but if if somebody actually truly has mold growing in their lungs we should be able to see that on a CAT scan we should be able to identify it we should be able to go and biopsy it we should be able to go and collect it and if that&amp;#39;s exactly what grows out on the culture after we take a biopsy or culture we can tailor antifungals for that particular thing in the sense though that someone may be having uh symptoms of some sort of infection or something and there&amp;#39;s nothing on the CAT scan um it&amp;#39;s harder to really isolate exactly which one it would be and what would be the right treatment although there are some syndromes um known as RADS or reactive Airways disease uh where you can have an exposure to something that&amp;#39;s so egregious that even though you don&amp;#39;t get exposed that thing again it can still cause persistent uh um difficulty with breathing it&amp;#39;s very similar by the way to um to asthma so for instance somebody let&amp;#39;s say someone&amp;#39;s working in a vat and uh there&amp;#39;s a chemical that&amp;#39;s spilled and they get an incredible amount of inhalation of that chemical it&amp;#39;s well known that these people can go on and have these types of problems even though their lungs May image uh correctly and they may never be exposed to that chemical again let&amp;#39;s talk about the T in
