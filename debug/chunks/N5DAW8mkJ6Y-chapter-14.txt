# [01:28:27] Influenza, Flu Shots, Swiss Cheese Model; Flu Shot Risks?

human yeah I want to talk about the other aspects of new start nutrition exercise um trust rest Etc but before we do that I want to touch on something that I&amp;#39;ve been curious about for a long time it&amp;#39;s somewhat controversial I&amp;#39;ve stated my stance on this previously took some heat for it um but maybe I&amp;#39;ll revise my stance you see a lot of patients in the ICU with flu yeah obvious VI ly the flu can be deadly in some circumstances but for most people that are healthy generally healthy first of all how concerning is flu like should I really be concerned about flu this winter season even though I feel robust and then the second question is do you personally get the quote unquote flu shot I said on a previous podcast that I don&amp;#39;t get it um and I took a lot of heat for that I understand that the flu shot does protect against certain forms of flu not all of them uh that statement was um kind of pushed out there by folks saying that I was going against CDC guidelines I&amp;#39;m not going against CDC guidelines people should do as they choose they should just know what they&amp;#39;re doing I&amp;#39;ve never gotten a flu shot I I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ve ever gotten the flu um but that&amp;#39;s my personal choice and it&amp;#39;s not based on any specific fear of the flu shot it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s never been an issue for me and I&amp;#39;m okay with getting a cold or a flu every couple of years years feeling miserable for a week or two and bouncing back I feel like that&amp;#39;s good to develop my own antibodies but maybe I&amp;#39;m thinking about this completely irrationally so do you get the flu shot do you recommend the flu shot for healthy people do you recommend the flu shot for people that are met metabolically challenged yeah it&amp;#39;s a good question I think it&amp;#39;s and the approach that I take is is the approach that I take with any intervention in medicine every intervention in medicine has a benefit and every intervention has a risk no matter what it is so for me because I work in an intensive care unit around sick patients all the time I&amp;#39;m exposed to a lot of flu I mean you literally walk in and the next day they say oh by the way that guy he had the flu so you you find out after the fact so for me I&amp;#39;ve always since I&amp;#39;ve been a physician I&amp;#39;ve always gotten the flu shot every single year do you get it multiple times per season no just once okay so at the beginning of the flu season when they say flu shot available now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a mix of antibodies against known um strains of the flu yeah interesting the the way that they try to figure out or guess uh the way it is because that&amp;#39;s what it is it&amp;#39;s a guess is they look six months earlier to see what happened in the Southern Hemisphere and they see what was circulating there and then they believe that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to be circulating uh in the Northern Hemisphere and they do the same in in the South they look and see what&amp;#39;s circulating up here and they try to figure out what it&amp;#39;s going to be there so there&amp;#39;s usually about three or four different ones that they try to put in there ever since 2009 they&amp;#39;ve tried to put one in there about 2009 because that was a really bad year we we mentioned that in terms of that study on sunlight but but in terms of the uh of the the side effects as a result of that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been pretty bad I mean to give you an example I had a patient really recently in the Intensive Care Unit uh this patient came in uh very poorly controlled diabetes hemoglobin A1c of like 16 17 it was very bad and she developed uh she got the flu and she her immune system was not well she actually also got uh a very bad fungal infection that was near fatal um and so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the typical patient that we&amp;#39;re going to see who&amp;#39;s going to have that type of a bad reaction to the flu people who are imuno compromised people who are not metabolically healthy these are the ones that are wide open and so a flu virus is going to to do a lot of of damage there so what does the flu vaccine do it gives the immune system a an advanced notice of what this antigen is and that has two effects what a lot of people believe is that it&amp;#39;s going to protect you from ever getting infected it&amp;#39;s not the case uh you can still get infected but what happens is that the symptomatology or the the side effects of that infection will be greatly diminished so instead of you being hospitalized perhaps maybe you&amp;#39;re only you coming down with the flu and you stay at home a lot of people would say I got the flu shot and it didn&amp;#39;t help I got the flu anyway what we don&amp;#39;t know is how severe that infection would have been in the first place so that&amp;#39;s why for people who are imuno compromised I generally recommend it to get the flu shot or people that are exposed to a lot of flu because like you you work in the ICU but it and if I may like do you um do your kids get the flu shot yeah we give them the flu shot as well um it&amp;#39;s more because they&amp;#39;re the kids of doctors who might bring home the flu got it um and and more than anything else but uh there there was a point where we were not doing it it when they&amp;#39;re in their teenage years that&amp;#39;s when we start actually giving them the flu shot that was just a personal opinion even though I know it&amp;#39;s approved up down to 6 months of age I believe so you started your kids once they were in their teen years yeah yeah um I remember one year our our uh our son Ryan he he uh he got some some virus I don&amp;#39;t know what it was but he had very bad diarrhea and we had to take him to the uh to the to the emergency room to actually get an IV and get fluids into him he was very dehydrated um I don&amp;#39;t know what that was I don&amp;#39;t know if it was Rota virus but something was going around that year so and he&amp;#39;s perfectly healthy so this is something that can happen and um you just have to look at the risks and benefits so if well I am telling you that I&amp;#39;ve never gotten a flu shot am I being irresponsible as a citizen I I don&amp;#39;t tend I mean I go places I go to restaurants I go to the gym I I um I&amp;#39;ve remained healthy um for the most part I&amp;#39;m an occasional sniffle here and there every couple years I&amp;#39;ll get it&amp;#39;s been a long time actually now that I think about it I think irresponsible is probably too strong of a word the way I look at things is is through what I call the Swiss Cheese model I don&amp;#39;t know if You&amp;#39; ever heard of the Swiss Cheese model I love swiss cheese okay so the Swiss Cheese model says this every if I cut up a bunch of pieces of Swiss cheese you&amp;#39;ll know that every piece has a hole in it right or maybe a couple holes and if you line up those pieces of Swiss cheese those holes might be in different places so if you are let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re on one end of those multiple slices of Swiss cheese and little particles are coming through if you have enough pieces of those swiss cheese no no particles are going to get through and and that&amp;#39;s really what we look at in medicine we don&amp;#39;t just depend on one slice of Swiss cheese like in the operating room for instance we don&amp;#39;t want to have infections so what do we do we sterilize the instruments but we don&amp;#39;t just leave it there right we sterilize the skin that we&amp;#39;re going to ins size we make sure that the room is the right temperature the right humidity because that has an effect we make sure it&amp;#39;s under positive pressure the the surgeon is wearing a mask he&amp;#39;s also wearing sterile gloves so we we we go through we try to do everything that we can possibly do so that if there is a breakdown in one place we still have a bunch of other swiss cheese slices in place it&amp;#39;s the same thing with the flu and new start so nutrition exercise water all of those things and then at the end when you&amp;#39;ve done that for yourself if you want to have extra protection you want to add on another piece of Swiss cheese then you well you can talk to your doctor see what the risks and the benefits are and then make that decision if that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s right for you are there any known risks of the so-called flu shot um and if so what what&amp;#39;s the percentage risk yeah well definitely there are risks in terms of allergies so they&amp;#39;ll they should be asking you when you get it you know have you ever been allergic to the flu shop before I mean you can have anaphylactic shock that&amp;#39;s one possibility um of course you can have that with anything right but specifically to the flu there was actually interestingly one year and I can&amp;#39;t remember which year it was but there was a I think it was in Europe and we actually never got it in the United States but there was a rash of narcolepsy that was occurring so something about the the flu vaccine was causing a reaction that was causing an autoimmune response and the antibodies they believe were were acting against the um where hypocretin is made in the in the uh in the brain hypothalamus yeah and uh and so they they they noticed that there was an association I don&amp;#39;t know if they actually determined that it was causal but they stopped that uh that brand I I would not want narcolepsy I used to work in a laboratory for a summer that wor uh studying narcolepsy it was the laboratory Emanuel minol Lab at at Stanford School of Medicine um he and his colleague s nishino identified the uh hypocretin ere yes mutation as the source of narcolepsy and people with narcolepsy people think it&amp;#39;s just excessive daytime sleepiness but anytime they have it at the extreme in the extreme examples when people with narcolepsy have any kind of emotional activation they fall asleep and they have cataplexy too so they can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t drive they become essentially paralyzed like a like a sleep aonia right um pretty devastating disease so it sounds like um that particular strain of the flu shot in was neurotox in some way yeah there was one particular string we&amp;#39;d never seen it before um never seen it since and so yeah it&amp;#39;s uh there are these one-offs right but you know everything has risk sure and so the example that I give is look I I&amp;#39;m in the ICU all day and I&amp;#39;m seeing people with you know occasionally with head beds right and they&amp;#39;re on a blood thinner and but I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t go back to my clinic in the pulmonary office and then take everybody off of blood thinners because we know that blood thinners epidemiologically in the long run actually save lives because they prevent Strokes heart attacks things of that nature so what we try to do is figure out what&amp;#39;s the right individual for this medication or what&amp;#39;s the you know what&amp;#39;s the right medicine for this type you know type of situation and that that requires training and that requires you know sometimes you have calculators that can figure out these risks in the winter months when flu
