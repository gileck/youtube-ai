# [02:32:22] Air, Smoking, Vaping, Nicotine Gum

anyway yeah um that&amp;#39;s a great segue to air yeah um I&amp;#39;ve heard conflicting things uh Visa should we sleep with an air humidifier should we sleep with a cold room under warm blankets you know uh lowering core body temperature definitely helps us fall asleep but that&amp;#39;s under conditions where we&amp;#39;re not combating an illness I have had the experience several times now to the extent that I really believe it&amp;#39;s a real effect where if a room is extremely cold even if I&amp;#39;m under warm blankets breathing that cold air at night I&amp;#39;ll often get some um respiratory stuff going on probably because of a drying out of the respiratory Pathways yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very possible um so let&amp;#39;s talk about air um 30,000 foot level first of all don&amp;#39;t inhale anything that&amp;#39;s not either a medicine designed for your lungs or air itself so goes without saying but smoking um cigar vaping exactly sorry folks vaping might be better for you than smoking but it&amp;#39;s still terrible for your lungs I I&amp;#39;m The Vaping Community hates me because they want me to say it&amp;#39;s not carcinogenic but the data show that it can cause popcorn lung I mean it&amp;#39;s just not good no uh right before Co hit I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many young kids were being admitted to my ICU on ventilators um it was a little different at that time because it was so expansive that people were making Vitamin E oil to cut the nicotine and they were making basically garage out of their garage brand Vapes and selling it and these kids were ending up in the ICU this is totally unrelated to co this is totally unrelated to co okay and to be fair totally unrelated to the brand of vaping the brand names so this is off-label stuff people making their own thing and selling it it was crazy but let&amp;#39;s talk about you know briefly the brand so yeah we&amp;#39;re starting to understand now that um vaping doesn&amp;#39;t have as many toxins that smoking does but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a healthy choice and contrary to to the thought process is that it really doesn&amp;#39;t get people off of nicotine in fact there&amp;#39;s higher concentrations of nicotine in the vape than than in regular cigarettes very high concentrations incidentally what what are your thoughts on non-smoked non Vaped non- dipped non- snuffed nicotine so nicotine gum nicotine pouches I mean it&amp;#39;s a will raise blood pressure vas a constrictor but definitely increases alertness while causing relaxation I&amp;#39;ll come clean I occasionally will take a milligram or two which is very little um of nicotine gum um yeah so you know but never smok or vape or Dipper snuff it I use it all the time in my patients who I&amp;#39;m trying to get off of smoking so um and and that&amp;#39;s a safer alternative especially for the lungs right because this is not they&amp;#39;re not um atins that are going into the lungs so no problem with that especially if it&amp;#39;s used to to get them off of smoking um it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s something that we use all the time do you use nicotine no no yeah there&amp;#39;s a a massive expansion in the number of people taking nicotine pouches now yeah and and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s something that affects the brain as you know it affects the um pregnant women um affects a a number of aspects of of the nervous system we we have receptors called nicotinic receptors for a reason because that&amp;#39;s the neurotransmitter so um yeah it has an effect it is highly habit forming SL addictive um it does seem that at least in people 60 and older there may be some mild cognitive sparing or enhancement due to nicotine use I think that&amp;#39;s an area that needs further exploration yeah I I&amp;#39;m not familiar with that data but certainly something to look into yeah yeah I&amp;#39;m not going to try and convince you to get on nicotine I I I&amp;#39;ll also say that it it doesn&amp;#39;t just hit the nicotinic receptors it&amp;#39;ll also hit the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and that&amp;#39;s one reason why if you do take nicotine gum or use nicotine gums or pouches what you&amp;#39;ll notice is when you don&amp;#39;t use it you&amp;#39;ll feel as if your throat is a little um mildly irritated and and then you take it and it and it relaxes it interesting and this is one of the more subtle but powerful ways in which it is habit forming is that people feel like they&amp;#39;re more verbally fluid they can breathe easier when they&amp;#39;re taking nicotine but it&amp;#39;s a vasal constrictor so that for those interested in performance enhancing effects um it&amp;#39;s run pushing you in the opposite direction anyway so in terms of air
