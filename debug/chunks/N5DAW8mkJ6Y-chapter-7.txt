# [00:38:46] Sunlight \u0026 Cancer Risk?, Tools: UV Light, Clothing \u0026 Sunlight Exposure

out into the sun yeah the um dermatologist that I hosted on this podcast Dr Teo solmani um also happens to be a Derm oncologist so his specialty is skin cancer anwers and um I was surprised to learn but you know we&amp;#39;ve talked about several times Now offline as well too and I I was surprised to learn that the sunlight induced cancers of the skin while they do exist that&amp;#39;s real right get too much UV exposure you&amp;#39;re going to um age your skin more rapidly you&amp;#39;re uh going to increase the likelihood that you&amp;#39;ll get a skin cancer however this was really surprising to me according to him there is no evidence that sunlight induces the deadly types of cancers like melanoma those are more genetically determined yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s not to say that sunlight can&amp;#39;t damage skin but it is really interesting that more and more data and clinical trials included are pointing to exactly what you&amp;#39;re saying which is that more sunlight exposure is beneficial and the risks of sunlight exposure can largely be offset by limiting your exposure to excessive UV and it&amp;#39;s pretty easy nowadays with any app um a lot of zeroc cost apps out there I can put uh links to one or two in the show note captions that I like that have no affiliation to whatsoever by the way um we&amp;#39;ll tell you when the UV index is highest it&amp;#39;s in the middle of the day typically and so it&amp;#39;s possible to get plenty of sunlight on your skin without exposing yourself to excessive UV yeah and I even take it a step further because we we know that a single layer of clothing can actually is pretty good at blocking ultraviolet lights right but remember what we talked about infrared infrared can penetrate through so if someone is fair skin and they&amp;#39;re concerned about getting skin damage wear a broad rimmed hat put a put a a long sleeve shirt on but get outside because that&amp;#39;s where the infrared especially if you&amp;#39;re around uh you know Green uh green uh shrubs and and and leaves and things because those are a lot of infrared light we know that green spaces are are are beneficial in terms of that and we talked about you know Louisville Kentucky that there&amp;#39;s a benefit there just by putting the tree there I love those data I&amp;#39;d like to take a quick
