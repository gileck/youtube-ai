# [02:25:25] Zinc Supplementation, Copper; Exogenous Interferon

wonderful um other things that have been shown to improve symptomology or perhaps even immune system function um maybe we could talk about zinc yeah I take what most people would consider very high levels of zinc and I&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a long time and I&amp;#39;m going to continue to do it because I I do my blood work and I it works for me I think there is actually good data for zinc um some people might uh might disagree but I think the studies that I&amp;#39;ve seen seem to show that that zinc supplementation can be beneficial um the theoretical of course and I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re familiar with it is is the copper deficiency and if you&amp;#39;re checking that then that&amp;#39;s fine um the recommendations that I have seen um is 40 milligrams of Elemental zinc so you have to be careful when you look up zinc on your on your bottle tell you how many milligrams but it&amp;#39;s the entire molecule that they&amp;#39;re measuring so you&amp;#39;ve got it&amp;#39;ll also say how many milligrams of Elemental zinc that is equivalent to and the recommendation that I&amp;#39;ve heard from people is is 40 milligrams but um I don&amp;#39;t I if you&amp;#39;re checking your copper levels then you should be fine yeah well it&amp;#39;s never charted out by body weight either so I weigh you know 215 lbs so um what&amp;#39;s the risk of copper depletion um blood um deficiencies and things of that nature yeah okay I&amp;#39;ll get my copper levels checked I believe it&amp;#39;s in my blood uh blood panel um it is in my blood panel and I don&amp;#39;t have a flag there but I&amp;#39;ll keep an eye on it yeah liver I believe also is involved with copper as well so what is zinc doing to improve immune system function there&amp;#39;s a couple of enzymes that use zinc as a co-actor um and I believe that that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s related to uh I&amp;#39;m not I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly which ones they are but zinc is used as a co-actor in some of the enzymatic reactions of the immune system yeah why doesn&amp;#39;t somebody Market an interfere on inhaler or n nasal spray you know actually they they are looking at that um when I was researching this for you know the uh intravenous interferon um I was I remember seeing something about interferon in terms of a nasal spray I haven&amp;#39;t seen that yet though someone out there who&amp;#39;s industrious can yeah can um create one it doesn&amp;#39;t make you feel very nice okay I mean uh when when these patients for instance uh well this might be material to understand too for many years we had hepatitis C that was incurable and um interferon actually is the is the cure there was a point where we was used to give uh infusions of interferon to cure people with hepatitis C um but when we gave them the treatment they felt horrible felt like they had the flu and it&amp;#39;s for good reasons because when you have high levels of interferon you you do have the flu it feels like that it&amp;#39;s worth touching on this that so much of the uh symptomology when we have a flu or a cold or what have you is the is the immune system doing its thing the fever the congestion or correct um and we think think of that as the illness but it&amp;#39;s often the byproduct of the body trying to extrude or kill exactly nobody likes congestion um so you know I don&amp;#39;t have I don&amp;#39;t mind treating that but I think out of all of those symptoms that you mentioned there the one that I think is probably the most beneficial to keep is the fever what
