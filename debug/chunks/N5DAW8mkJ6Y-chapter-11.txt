# [00:59:48] Cloudy Days; Sunlight, Primitive Therapy, Hospitals

okay so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very helpful um I think a lot of people hearing about the role of sunlight and long wavelength light in particular its potential influ inuence on improving overall immune system function metabolic Health Etc might think that this sounds a little bit kind of biacky because the moment we get into red lights that&amp;#39;s sort of like cold plunges it&amp;#39;s kind of immediately associated with kind of uh biohacking people say it&amp;#39;s Bro Science this kind of thing I just wanted to remind people that in the early 1900s a Nobel Prize was given for the use of phototherapy which is what we&amp;#39;re describing for the treatment of Lupus so the idea that um that specific wavelengths of light can be used in order to treat cellular health or offset uh cellular disease is not a new idea at all and you mentioned this earlier but I just wanted to underscore that for people um the other way of looking at all this is that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s primitive so some people will say oh this is biohacking right other people say well this is just primitive like get sunlight of course but you you made a very key point which is that the way we interact with light and it in particular with sunlight nowadays is so disrupted compared to how it was just 10 15 especially 20 years ago I would just encourage people to pay attention for one week to how much time you&amp;#39;re actually getting outside now a few people will already be getting a lot of time outside but just pay attention how much time each day do you actually get outside yeah without sunglasses onh and just measure your total exposure to outdoor time let alone sunlight I I think that&amp;#39;s just an important experiment for people to do and because when one does that you start to realize my goodness I&amp;#39;m hardly getting outside at all yeah there was a study that was done uh looking at just this except they actually used watches that uh was able to detect how much light it wasn&amp;#39;t infrared light but just Total light and the the name of the the study was basically you know dark days and bright nights and and that is associated with higher mortality we know of course about Bright Nights not being good so not having a dark room to sleep in these are things that can impair melatonin that&amp;#39;s associated with all all sorts of of bad things but the dark days was something that um we really had not seen and it was very interesting they actually could show by the hour that if you were having light coming in exactly what that did to your mortality and mortality went up dramatically as you were still in in daylight about midnight but right around 7 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning 8:00 in the morning if you were out there and you&amp;#39;re getting light now instead of uh light being a liability it was now a benefit and it dropped dramatically I also want to point out that when it&amp;#39;s raining out or when it&amp;#39;s very cold out even when it&amp;#39;s dark and cloudy quote unquote dark and cloudy there&amp;#39;s far more photons coming through the cloud cover during the day than at night people I can&amp;#39;t tell you if I had a dollar for every time somebody said to me online and in person there&amp;#39;s no sunlight where I live listen go outside on the shortest day of the year yeah go outside folks and look at how bright it is at 10:00 a.m. or even 2:00 p.m. compare that to the middle of the night there is sunlight unless you live in a cave there&amp;#39;s Sun sunlight all year round it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just striking so this morning you know it&amp;#39;s uh for Southern California it&amp;#39;s pretty overcast today there it&amp;#39;s a Misty Rain a little bit more and I didn&amp;#39;t want to go outside and get my sunlight this morning but I know I was going to be in studio all day and so I went downstairs and I put on a beanie cap and a hoodie and I just got outside with sunglasses and um got some sunlight in my eyes you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really bright outside even when it&amp;#39;s raining yeah it&amp;#39;s really bright outside even when it&amp;#39;s storming and I think people somehow they think that if it&amp;#39;s not a clear sunny day there&amp;#39;s no sunlight to be had correct and they many uh gems that you&amp;#39;re providing us today but one key take takeaway is I want people to understand there is sunlight all year round yeah I yes unless you live truly a Subterranean life that you are underground there is sunlight during the daytime yeah and if there is we have to work on that um to your point about it being primitive you know um I was looking at the history of this and it was actually very interesting to me you know we used to have uh tuberculosis sanitariums at very high altitude and part of that treatment was getting out into the the Sun at very high altitude you have less atmosphere more ultraviolet light coming in more light in general coming in and when I started to look at this I I found it was very interesting what people started to say and what what these people were actually saying at the time about sunlight um you know in terms of these these people these Physicians and these healthc care providers back in the 1800s they didn&amp;#39;t have all of the scientific accoutrements that we have today they didn&amp;#39;t have x-rays and things of that nature but one thing that they were very very good at probably better than we are good at is their power of observation they they were able to get a stethoscope put it on the chest listen to the the space between the second heart sound and the opening snap and be able to say this person&amp;#39;s got severe mitro stenosis say this is the one you need to operate on and they would do that and and sure enough when they opened it up sure enough this is the one that had you know so the power of observation was probably better back in the 1800s so what do you have you have people like Florence Nightingale who is the the founder of modern nursing and she was there uh you know in um uh there during the uh the Crimean War taking care of British uh soldiers and she wrote down I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing basically what she said she said look when it comes to treating the whole patient the one thing that more than anything else is beneficial for these these soldiers to recover is fresh air but she said a very close second is direct sunlight getting them out into Sunshine getting them out out into into direct sunlight um when I was looking at this the Smithsonian Institute a couple years ago a few years ago put out their top 100 most influential Americans of all time one of them was this lady she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s most translated female author in in the world her name is Ellen G white and she had a third grade education but she was also very interested in health health reform and she wrote at that time in the 1800s that we ought to be getting out into the sunlight that that&amp;#39;s makes a big difference interestingly something else that she said that I found really amazing and this is they&amp;#39;re writing this before we understand circadian rhythm before we understand melatonin she wrote down she&amp;#39;s like hey this idea of keeping the lights on after after 9:00 it&amp;#39;s a wretched Health destroying habit every light should be extinguished she said after 9:00 so I know about her sayings a little bit because she was the the founder of lumaland University which is where I went to school so but uh just we had this knowledge as you said we we had hospitals that were designed specifically to get people out of the hospital and into the sunlight like you could see the architecture was designed for this why don&amp;#39;t we do this today I think we ought to but I I kind of have a sense you asked the question why don&amp;#39;t we do this today I have patients that I take care of now that I understand this I have patients that I have in the Intensive Care Unit that I want to get outside in the sunlight I actually try to get them out it&amp;#39;s difficult to do these people are critical um the people that we admit to the hospitals today are far sicker than the people that we admitted to sanitariums and and hospitals in the 1800s you you have to make sure that they don&amp;#39;t desaturate you got to take the oxygen tank out there with them you&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that they don&amp;#39;t have a code I mean you&amp;#39;re outside right so you&amp;#39;re outside of the the bowels of the hospital where your support system is it&amp;#39;s a little bit of a risk to get those patients out there nevertheless I&amp;#39;ve convinced um some of my hospital staff to do that and I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve had a number of success stories where we&amp;#39;ve had patients that were ready to be intubated and we we got them outside in the sunlight and they steadily improved dramatically after days of getting worse and uh and they got better there was a lady that actually contacted me her name is Amy hanm H NM yhr if you want to look up she&amp;#39;s on social media her son this is a really amazing story her son contract basically at the age of 15 got uh leukemia got put on chemotherapy and this was in Minnesota fortunately it was in the summer time and he got admitted to the hospital with what they call neutropenic fever very high fevers very low white accounts as a result of the chemotherapy and his immune system was was completely shot and unfortunately he developed a very severe fungal infection in his lung called mucor and it just basically eats up the lung goes right to the blood vessels he got so bad that they there was there was only one solution that they had at the time and that was to take out the left lung so they took out the left lung and he continued to get worse the right lung became infected he started to to get worse had higher fever they had a meeting with the family 15 years old completely with it realizing that he&amp;#39;s dying and they have to tell him that he&amp;#39;s dying so they made him what they call no code or DNR and uh the staff came to him and you can imagine and I&amp;#39;ve been in this position before you&amp;#39;ve trying to do everything you possibly can and you just you can&amp;#39;t do anything else so they came to him the 15-year-old and they said you know this is it do you have any basically last wishes and you know Amy his mom told me that he&amp;#39;d like to play outside so he told them you know without any knowledge about what we&amp;#39;ve just been talking about he just this is his dying wish take me outside just I just want to go outside and and you know that nursing staff will move Heaven and Earth to do something that the patient requests to do uh even though it&amp;#39;s not going to you know benefit them they still want this is dying wish they&amp;#39;re going to do it so they they hooked up oxygen tanks they uh they they got this this 15-year-old boy in a in a hospital bed outside on BiPAP with auction tanks for 5 hours a day um his mom was telling me they also uh using something called a firefly device where they were just basically Shining Light onto him to see if it would work you know how the story ends he did not die in two days like they told him he got better his fever went away his oxygen requirements came down and and I&amp;#39;m not telling you this as a as a as a proof that this is what happens but you have to realize that he was in the hospital for six weeks under underneath you know LED lighting and as soon as he got outside fever went away and make a long story short after five days he came back inside they repeated the CT scan and she sent me the CT scans I&amp;#39;ve seen them we actually did a a little thing on our our megc channel on it and um it was the disease was almost gone there&amp;#39;s no explanation to this day they don&amp;#39;t have an explanation still alive today still alive he&amp;#39;s getting chemotherapy he he went from basically and of course he he&amp;#39;s missing a lung but he still has that lung he&amp;#39;s on he&amp;#39;s getting the the antifungal medication there&amp;#39;s no sign of the fungus anywhere so this is an anecdotal story it doesn&amp;#39;t prove anything and I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t present it as proof the things that I present as proof is randomized control trials epidemiological trials with with dose response curves these are things that we can actually show the science with the reason why I bring it up is because it shows what is it that we would need to do to get this type of treatment it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not easy to do but if there is a will there&amp;#39;s a way to do
