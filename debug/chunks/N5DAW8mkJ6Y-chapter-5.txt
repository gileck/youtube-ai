# [00:26:38] Infrared Light, Green Spaces, Health \u0026 Mortality

so how does this keep us safe from infection as long as we&amp;#39;re here yeah um what else is it doing to offset the 70% reduction in mitochondrial function because what we&amp;#39;re talking about now is um the role of melatonin within cells to um lower temperature and reduce these uh reactive oxygen species yes does that somehow offset the reduction in mitochondria that normally occurs it does and so there&amp;#39;s a so the increase in melatonin from infrared uh radiation going into the mitochondria is one aspect there&amp;#39;s a whole host of other aspects that occur there is cytochrome 4 oxidase again one of those enzymes in the electron transport chain can absorb infrared light there&amp;#39;s nitric oxide what what the whole effect of this is and the bottom line is is that when you have red light to near infrared light getting in that deep there is a increase in the efficiency of the mitochondria so this is the key point because if in fact with the theory of mitochondrial aging that we&amp;#39;re having a decrease in the efficiency of the mitochondria as we get older if there is something that we can do to reverse that or to at least prevent that from happening that can have a tremendous impact in our health overall so two points one uh one point about infrared and its characteristic and then number two let&amp;#39;s actually get to some data because we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re saying a bunch of things but what we really need is evidence-based stuff okay so the first thing there&amp;#39;s one other thing that I should mention about the effect of infrared light especially in nature and that is is that not only can It penetrate through clothes you may remember the Sony cam uh night vision thing uh back in the 90s where Sony came up with a night vision camera that you could take pictures at night and some enterprising youth probably a man fig figured out that you could use it during the day and you could see through clothes and presumably they took that off the market they took it off the market pretty quick yes um but there&amp;#39;s one other thing that&amp;#39;s really important to understand too and that is that believe it or not but the leaves on trees and grass anything with chlorophyll is highly reflective of infrared light what that means is that if you go out outside on a sunny day versus going outside on a sunny day surrounded by Green green spaces you&amp;#39;re going to get probably two three four times more infrared light in that environment than you would without that environment if you you could you could check this out you go to Google and just type in infrared photography and click images and you will see any kind of infrared filtered light when it shows a tree or grass it it looks like it&amp;#39;s lit up like it&amp;#39;s got snow on it it&amp;#39;s bright white it&amp;#39;s very reflective on a hot summer day if you go outside and touch some object that&amp;#39;s in the sun it&amp;#39;s going to be extremely hot touch a leaf it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not hot at all it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s reflecting that light in fact the coolest place in a garden on a hot summer day is where it&amp;#39;s under a tree because all of that all of that infrared light is being reflected off so and and just to jump ahead here but we know from years and Decades of data that people who live in green spaces have reduced diabetes reduced hypertension reduced mortality just living in green spaces is it possible to tease away the effect from the other things associated with living in green spaces because fortunately our audience is train to think scientifically and they&amp;#39;ll know well it&amp;#39;s not necessarily causal right people live in green spaces tend to walk more they tend to perhaps eat more fruits and vegetables and on and on so so uh getting on to that uh there was a study that was just done in Louisville Kentucky four square miles they measured everybody in that four square miles h R hscrp what&amp;#39;s hscp it&amp;#39;s basically it&amp;#39;s a surrogate marker for inflammation in the body and then they did this they did something incredible they brought in 8,000 plus trees mature trees and they planted those trees in that four square mile area took them about a year two to three years later they went out nothing the the income of these people living in this four square mile area did not change the presumably they did not do any exercise programs in this area everything was the same the only thing they did was plant trees and they went out and they rechecked everybody&amp;#39;s highly sensitive CRP levels they drop by 133% wow and that&amp;#39;s about on the order almost on the order of Doing exercise three times a week I should mention that um crpc reactive protein has been associated with a number of blinding eye diseases um uh associated with inflammation and basically um everything bad you can imagine in every organ of the body heart attack uh esia yeah this kind of thing um incredible yeah so
