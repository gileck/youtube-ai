# [00:10:46] Sunlight, Mitochondria, Tool: Infrared Light \u0026 Melatonin

huberman let&amp;#39;s start off with one of my favorite topics would be the s in New Start let&amp;#39;s talk about sunlight listeners of this podcast or anyone that&amp;#39;s heard me on social media know that I&amp;#39;m you know as big a proponent of getting morning sunlight in one&amp;#39;s eyes as one could possibly be without repeating himself 10 million times per year uh it&amp;#39;s a daily activity that we just know has such an outsized positive effect on the whole setting of the Circadian rhythm and thereby improved daytime mood focus and alertness and nighttime sleep but the way you describe sunlight goes beyond just getting morning sunlight in one&amp;#39;s ey so if we want to parse this s sunlight in new start how are you thinking about sunlight is it sunlight on the skin is it also midday light not just morning sunlight is it a certain amount of sunlight and then maybe we can also talk about some of the underlying mechanisms yeah exactly so when you talk about sunlight and I&amp;#39;m a big believer I&amp;#39;m board certified in sleep medicine and I and I I&amp;#39;m cheering you on when you talk about these things because it&amp;#39;s so important that light into the retina does have an effect on the Circadian rhythm supermatic nucleus it does have an effect on mood goes to the per cular nucleus in the brain and has an effect there those are well known and very important um what I&amp;#39;m talking about when I&amp;#39;m talking about sunlight is an aspect of light that is not very well known in terms of its visible effects so we we know about the visible effects of light these are photons that are coming into the eyes that we can see what I&amp;#39;m discussing and what I&amp;#39;m talking about is the is the effect of sunlight on the human body the skin penetrating into the human body now this at first sounds kind of uh woooo I guess we could say but the the point that I want to make here is understanding that when we look at the sun we are seeing about 38% of that energy coming from the sun is in the visible spectrum there&amp;#39;s a whole another 52% of the photons coming from the Sun in the infrared spectrum and on the other end on the ultraviolet side this is the part we have no problem understanding because we know that ultraviolet B light comes into our skin and it&amp;#39;s high energy so it&amp;#39;s able to actually move the bonds on these uh cholesterol derivatives in order to make vitamin D so we know that so now what do we say when I say hey I want to go outside to get some vitamin D we know that we&amp;#39;re going outside to get this light that we can&amp;#39;t see that&amp;#39;s very imperative to giving us something called vitamin D which is hormone in our body and it&amp;#39;s very very important on the other side of that though on the infrared side is is something that there&amp;#39;s new science new data that is coming out that is showing that it&amp;#39;s actually very very important and so that I I would point to a an article that really changed my my thinking on this and really open my eyes no pun intended there was an article that was published in 2019 uh in melatonin research by Scott Zimmerman and Russell Ryder and the the name of that article was melatonin Optics of the human body the Optics of the human body and what Scott Zimmerman and Russell Ryder set out to show is that in fact fact um infrared light because of its very long wavelength um it can penetrate through into the skin actually very deep and we&amp;#39;re not talking about how long a a path length goes through you have to remember that that this type of long wavelength can scatter and it can can scatter throughout up to they say up to 8 cm according to this this data a single Photon a single Photon can bounce around it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very low energy Photon uh but low energy photons because they&amp;#39;re very long in wavelength can penetrate very deeply a good way of thinking about this is you you know you pull up to a stop sign and a car pulls up next to you and they&amp;#39;re playing this really loud music right what do you hear in your car it&amp;#39;s very low frequency sound and the reason why that&amp;#39;s what you hear is because low frequency sound is the only kind of sound coming out of that guy&amp;#39;s radio that&amp;#39;s able to penetrate not only his car but go into your car and shake the steering wheel on your car it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the same thing like for instance if you were to go to the Grand Canyon and there&amp;#39;s a storm coming storm very far away what&amp;#39;s the first thing that you&amp;#39;re going to hear it&amp;#39;s low rumbling it&amp;#39;s because that low frequency energy is able to penetrate very deeply um there&amp;#39;s a astrophysicist in Europe uh in England actually Bob Fosbury he sent me a photograph of his hand in front of a infrared light source and it was almost like uh uh the first guy who took a X-ray of his hand Ren rigan guess is his name and uh he said he looked at his hand he says I almost like saw my own death cuz he could see the bones in his hand through the X-ray well Bob Fosbury who&amp;#39;s at the European space agency and is well tuned into this type of of understanding he put his hand in front of a infrared light sensor or infrared light source and took a infrared light photograph and the light comes through the hand it illuminates the entire hand uh and this is of course a lot more than a few millimeters and the mind in thing about it was you could not see any bones it was either penetrating through the bone or it was going around the bone and very clearly you could see that infrared light is able to go much more than just skin deep it penetrates through your clothes you you can actually test this out on a on a on a summer day or even on a winter day if the Sun is out wear a few clothes of uh layers of clothing go outside close your eyes and move around and see if you can feel where the sun is you can and the reason is is because it&amp;#39;s that infrared radiation that&amp;#39;s able to penetrate through the clothes penetrate through your skin actually activate the heat sensors in your body and actually go much deeper than that that&amp;#39;s actually in a straight line after it does that it hits something and then it bounces around a couple of more times maybe a few hundred more times and so the point of that paper the Optics of the human body is that we have this understanding or this idea that light simply hits our skin and that&amp;#39;s where it ends and that&amp;#39;s not the case why that&amp;#39;s important is because of the effect of this type of infrared light has on mitochondria and that&amp;#39;s really the mind-blowing aspect of this is that mitochondria are like engines in your in your cells right they&amp;#39;re like engines in your car the engine in your car Burns fuel makes Locomotion and in the process of making that Locomotion it creates heat and that heat if not dealt with can shut down your engine well in the mitochondria you&amp;#39;ve got this process occurring making ATP which is basically the currency of energy in in the cell and in the process of doing this it makes oxidative stress oxidate reactive oxygen species if you don&amp;#39;t deal with those reactive oxygen species that could shut down the mitochondria and um and and quite truly just about every single chronic disease that we have in this country whether it&amp;#39;s diabetes hypertension heart disease dementia uh all of those they all has have at the root of them mitochondrial dysfunction and this this goes to a much bigger picture of the mitochondrial Theory of Aging we know that after 40 years the output of mitochondria which is ATP drops by about 70% 70 70 can you imagine being in your house and somehow the energy production to your house drops by 70% can you imagine what an impact that would have on just about every function that goes on in your house this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening in the cell and so what does this have to do with sunlight well here&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve shown that the mitochondria actually make on site melatonin in orders of magnitude higher concentration that is made in the pineal gland really yes so they&amp;#39;ve actually done the work where they have serotonin they are actually labeling the carbon in serotonin and showing that that melatonin in orders of magnitude higher concentration are being made on site in the mitochondria okay I have to ask
