# [01:43:57] Water, Sodium; Innate Immune System, Fever \u0026 Hydrotherapy

hour.com huberman to get 20% off let&amp;#39;s talk about water and air I think I like many people are curious as to you know how much water I drink is that influencing my susceptibility to uh infections Etc um water on the body uh water we get into this kind of thing and then air uh humidity temperature um ozone any anything interesting in those yeah um let&amp;#39;s talk about water so the most obvious one is the internal use of water and what&amp;#39;s interesting about that is that we actually can do a blood test on people and it&amp;#39;s called the sodium concentration one of the first things you learn as a medical student is that the sodium concentration in somebody has very little to do with how much sodium they take into their body it has much more to do with how much water they take into their body so the more water they take in the lower the sodium concentration goes but it&amp;#39;s very well regulated there&amp;#39;s a study that was done a number of years ago that looked at the chances of death so mortality and sodium concentration and as sodium concentration went up so did the chances of dying so it&amp;#39;s important to drink water how much water you know there&amp;#39;s this old eight glasses of water uh thing it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s probably not that much but uh it it certainly is important so internal use of water is well known I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a substrate that allows your kidneys to to dump toxins and you need to to flush those things out and you sweat especially if you&amp;#39;re exercising you&amp;#39;re going to need to take more water in because you&amp;#39;re sweating you&amp;#39;re breathing faster you have something called insensible losses of water but I think um the other part of water that I&amp;#39;d like to talk about is not the internal use of water which is pretty obvious and and the data is there but the external use of water and the reason why I bring that up is in the context of what we&amp;#39;re talking about which is illnesses and flu and viruses one of the properties of water that is is very very important is its high enthalpy what does that mean means it takes a lot of energy to raise water the substance 1 degre Cel and the opposite is also true so if you put warm water on someone uh it can transfer a lot of energy into that person without losing temperature why is that important if you want to use if you want to increase someone&amp;#39;s body body temperature water is a very good way of doing it if you&amp;#39;ve ever gone into a sauna and it&amp;#39;s a dry sauna you haven&amp;#39;t yet put the little Ladle onto the heating you can you can tolerate 170 180 degree uh sauna pretty well as soon as you put that water on the heat just starts to come down on you and that&amp;#39;s because water is such a very good way of transmitting that heat so why is that important let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s put that away for a little bit and I&amp;#39;ll explain why that&amp;#39;s important let&amp;#39;s switch gears and talk about viruses in the immune system so your immune system is divided into two components an annate immune system and an Adaptive immune system the Adaptive immune system is what we&amp;#39;ve all learned about in terms of vaccines and antibodies and all the things the discussion that we&amp;#39;ve had the last four or five years you see something very specific your immune system does and it makes an antibody directly against that if it&amp;#39;s slightly different the antibody response is not going to be as effective so it&amp;#39;s very high tuned very specific that&amp;#39;s the Adaptive immune system the innate immune system on the other hand is the one that goes out first gobbles things up and presents it to the Adaptive immune system but there&amp;#39;s also something else in the innate immune system that&amp;#39;s very important and that is the system that has to do with recognizing damaged molecules and recognizing pathological molecules there are certain pathological patterns PM is pathologic iCal Associated molecular patterns that the innate immune system recognizes without ever having seen it and it can take those things out and the greatest tool that the innate immune system has to take those things out is something called interferon interferon is an extremely important um molecule it has a very wide ranging ability to take out viruses something that&amp;#39;s important to understand is that with all of the variants that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about with covid with all all of the the different strains that we have of influenza none of that matters with interferon interferon has very why and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s such an important molecule it&amp;#39;s been said that the immune system is so well-designed that there are no viruses that can infect it unless they have countermeasures and that is absolutely true this was first seen when SARS kovy 2 came out they looked at SARS kovi 1 the original one that came out in 200 too and and sure enough that virus SARS kov1 if you want to call it that or just SARS had a mechanism contained within it to neutralize and to suppress the secretion of interferon uh they did some searching and they looked at SARS kov 2 and sure enough mac 1 which is a a gene in SARS kov 2 is is a is a gene that is specifically I don&amp;#39;t want to say designed but it&amp;#39;s there to get around interferon that should tell you how important interferon is so with that in mind let&amp;#39;s go back to our talk about water and temperature there was a number of studies that had been done looking at temperature interferon and what they showed this was an inv vitro study where they took lymphocytes they put it into a medium and they bathed it in uh LPS LPS is basically a a molecule that is seen in bacteria that usually sets off the immune system so you have lymphocytes you have LPS and then what they did was they slowly increased the temperature and they measured interferon once it hit 39Â° C there was a 10-fold increase in interferon secretion from the lymphocytes 39 degrees for those uh who are on the Fahrenheit system that&amp;#39;s about 102.2 okay so slight fever slight fever yeah or or a good fever yeah good fever so what do this means this means that and this gets into the whole discussion philosophically about fevers in general should you block them exactly and I&amp;#39;ll tell you in the hospital I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll get so many calls hey doctor this patient has a fever and and the the idea is is that the fever is part of the problem and we need to fix the fever because it&amp;#39;s part of the problem by the way that was the same thought process in the in the 1918 Spanish flute pandemic that we had aspirin had just been discovered bare aspirin 18 1999 and uh it was great it seemed because aspirin took away fever it took away the body aches it took away the pain and all of that was subscribed to the virus that was going on they didn&amp;#39;t know even know it was a virus just the influenza disease and so uh it was being used almost excessively in fact in many cases probably toxically in these Army hospitals in 1918 people were coming in with the flu young people were coming in with the flu and they were getting high doses of aspiring they thought this was the way to treat it and the mortality rate the case fatality rate was like 6% it might have been even higher than that so getting back to water external use of water here is a way to deliver large amounts of energy that can be stored in water as a substance to the patient to elevate to actually help Elevate body temperature to see whether or not we can improve the innate immune system to actually help out in that type of a situation so we&amp;#39;re talking about hot baths hot baths sauna hot shower hot showers um probably the most effective way of doing it is uh the old term and again something that was used a 100 years ago is hydrotherapy or hot fermentations is the term that you&amp;#39;ll find if you look at the old literature this is where they would get hot towels linen towels they would uh soak it in water they would heat it up usually in a stove but you could do the same thing in a microwave the big thing is that you have to make sure you don&amp;#39;t burn yourself or the house down exactly um and so you would put a protective layer of of batting or or cloth on the patient and this would go on top of them and you would basically cover them up until you started to see them sweat and you do that for about 20 minutes once you start to see them sweat you know that you&amp;#39;re elevating the body temperature above the set point and what that&amp;#39;s supposed to do is to activate the immune system to uh to secrete interferent look we we have studies there&amp;#39;s a study that was published a couple years ago looking at covid giving exogenous interferon to people with covid-19 reduced hospitalizations by 50% so you&amp;#39;re getting around take exogenous interferon oh yeah absolutely you take it as a pill uh it&amp;#39;s an infusion you would digest it in the stomach so this this was an infusion that they gave to patients uh I&amp;#39;m surprised that I haven&amp;#39;t heard of like peptide Clinic selling into feron um can you can you inject interfer on sub subcutaneously uh you can in this this was actually published in the New England Journal of Medicine um it was uh interfer on Lambda I believe and it was a it was a uh phase three&amp;#39;s trial looking at getting FDA approval I think probably because of the fact that um we weren&amp;#39;t having as many hospitalized patients that probably hasn&amp;#39;t gone through but in that study it reduced hospitalizations by 50% wow for those
