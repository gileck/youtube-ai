# [01:53:46] Fever, Heat Hydrotherapy, Interferon \u0026 Immune System

hospitalizations by 50% wow for those that don&amp;#39;t have access to interfere on infusions um or a sauna or even a bath it so what is it you know a 5 to 10 minute hot shower then get under the blankets this kind of thing I mean this kind of um good old uh good old mom&amp;#39;s advice kind of stuff isn&amp;#39;t it interesting so I&amp;#39;ll tell you what the protocol was um there was uh and actually this is quite interesting historically there were a number of sanitariums in the northeast of the United States back at that time of the century and um they were run by the Adventist Church and their their way of dealing with the pandemic was different they were not using drug medications they were using hydrotherapy and sunlight some of the things that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about here and there was a guy by the name of Wells Rubble who was the medical director of the uh New England sanitarium and he said let&amp;#39;s just take a look and see what&amp;#39;s going on here let&amp;#39;s look at let&amp;#39;s pull the 10 sanitariums in this area see what&amp;#39;s gone on in terms of the way we treat the patients and then look at the published data from the the Army hospitals and there was a stark difference he divided into two sections the first phase of influenza is the early phase and and the major uh end point of that early phase was did they get pneumonia okay and then from pneumonia the second end point after that was the second phase and that was the question was did they die so where the sanitarium seem to do a much better job than in the Army hospitals was in that first phase they had one sixth of the people actually go to the pneumonia phase so what were they doing immediately they were doing hydrotherapy immediately they were doing uh which was basically increasing body temperature doing fever types of treatments getting them out into the sunlight you you can remember maybe in your mind&amp;#39;s eye these photographs of these Army hospital or these Army Camps and the tents were outside because they didn&amp;#39;t have any place to put them in some of these cases so the sunlight was good but the thing that they weren&amp;#39;t doing was the hydrotherapy once they got to the pneumonia stage there was no difference between what the sanitariums were doing and the Army hospitals the mortality was 50% remember this is prior to penicillin this is 1918 this is before 1928 when we discovered penicillin so once you hit pneumonia it was really difficult to treat so he he actually wrote this up and I actually found it in a uh someone directed it to me they actually showed it to me it was in a um it wasn&amp;#39;t even in a scientific journal that he published it it was some sort of periodical called life and health May 1st 1919 still remember in my head and he says hey this is what we did this is what they did they had one sixth of the mortal it in their uh in their institution and this was repeated multiple times this is not done in isolation there let&amp;#39;s lead you up to the to the big thing here there was a Nobel Prize that was given for this in 1927 Jules Wagner yor was a Austrian psychiatrist who noticed that in his uh patients that had neuros syphilis that when they had a fever their symptoms improved so this is again prior to penicillin he actually took patients with malaria and he took the blood from these patients and carefully infected his neurosyphilis patients with malaria and of course you know that malaria causes very very high fevers he cured neurosyphilis by causing fevers from malaria wild um and all he really had to do was heat them up um there was many ways of doing it at the time he closets sometimes they would inject foreign proteins to create a fever this was another way of doing it with malaria of course at the time they had the treatment for malaria right um quinine well and LPS will do this yes right LPS as you mentioned is lipid polysaccharide I think they get it from um yeast cell wall or something and um it&amp;#39;s a foreign antigen yeah it&amp;#39;s a contaminant in a lot of gray Market peptides and things that I suggest people don&amp;#39;t take you know there are a lot of people now who are interested in peptides and they buy them on the gray market and it says not for human or uh animal use research purposes only and people often say well why not use those you know why do people have to go through a physician and a compounding pharmacy if they&amp;#39;re going to explore that territory at all yeah and the reason is there it&amp;#39;s very clear that most of the gry market peptides have LPS um in them so small amounts but injected repeatedly over time people start getting the systemic inflammation and fever response there you go um you that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a little bit of a tangent but it gets to the same mechanism yeah
