# [00:48:41] Tools: Sunlight Exposure Duration, Winter Months

done 100 years ago 150 years ago just as a speculation why do you think we&amp;#39;ve migrated away from this frankly basic biochemical cellular understanding of how the Sun can benefit us I mean I feel like so much attention has been paid to how the Sun can damage our skin and quote unquote give us skin cancer that perhaps we overshot the Mark I think it has to do with scientific reductionism and what I mean to say by that is we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of data that shows that ultraviolet lights can cause cancer and so we&amp;#39;ve assumed that anything that has ultraviolet light can cause cancer there&amp;#39;s this complete dismissal of the fact that this ultraviolet light is packaged for the entire existence of human nature along with infrared lights and and if you it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing when you start to look at this because you start to realize that the infrared we we never get blue light or ultraviolet light ever without the presence of infrared lights unless it comes from an artificial Source exactly so this is really the first time in human history that we&amp;#39;ve had this preponderance of short wavelength AKA blue uh and green light in the absence of red light in fact maybe maybe we should just spend a couple of moments talking about what kind of sunlight exposures you recommend for people Depending on time of year yeah and then after that I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you briefly about this shift away from incandescent bulbs to uh indoor lighting with LEDs but just to make sure that um I don&amp;#39;t move us along before uh providing some of the key uh takeaways yes how much sunlight should we get each day in the shorter days of winter and in the fall and and when should this be done in the Jeffree study it was cleared that there was circadian regulation as you mentioned getting that sunlight excuse me getting that red light infrared light into one&amp;#39;s eyes early in the day was important if I&amp;#39;m living a standard life of of work and job and people are managing kids and all sorts of things sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to get into the sunlight because you&amp;#39;re just following a schedule how much time each day do you recommend independent of anything get you know related to getting sunlight in one&amp;#39;s eyes for circadian rhythm setting right so how much time what time of day yeah and what frequency across the week excellent question and and you&amp;#39;ve hit on on exactly the issue uh based on Glen Jeff&amp;#39;s studies based on another study that was actually done in Brazil it was actually an Interventional study in covid that showed that just 15 minutes a day for 7 days was enough to actually get people with covid out of the hospital faster this was a randomized placebo control double blinded amazing study 940 nanometers so when I talk to Glen Jeffrey about this he says he sees it in humans he sees it in bees he sees it in insects it&amp;#39;s all the same the mitochondria behave exactly the same when you say 940 nanometers you&amp;#39;re talking about long wavelength light coming from an artificial Source correct okay yeah that was 940 and it was actually very low it was about 2.9 mowatt per square centimeter so low energy most people yes um are not going to own a a red and far in a red a far red or an infrared light so yes um I just want to emphasize again for people you can get that wavelength and all the other relevant wavelengths from the Sun exactly that&amp;#39;s your that&amp;#39;s your red light therapy exactly and this is what I&amp;#39;m trying to say it&amp;#39;s like this is not like some powerful laser that they were using this is 2.9 Ms I mean sunlight all of sunlight is about 100 Mills per per centimeter squared by time it reaches at through the atmosphere through the atmosphere so 130 uh when it hits the Atmosphere by the time it hits you it&amp;#39;s about 100 if you&amp;#39;re looking at just in for red light we&amp;#39;re talking about 20 uh Mill per square cm and so this was 2.9 at a very specific wavelength so something that&amp;#39;s completely doable okay and so what they did it was 15 minutes a day for seven days and what uh what Glenn Jeffrey was telling me is that Roger it he says Roger it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I do if it&amp;#39;s in insects if it&amp;#39;s in bees if it&amp;#39;s in humans once you hit a certain point 15 20 minutes diminishing marginal utility the the the the Improvement after that point is so minimal that you only need about 15 to 20 minutes that&amp;#39;s why he was able to do his experiment in the eye about 3 minutes was all that was necessary so is this 15 minutes outside in the first three hours of your of your conventional day as I call it because people would say well the sun comes up later this conventional Day meaning after the sun after the sun has crossed the Horizon has R I don&amp;#39;t think it matters I don&amp;#39;t really think it matters I think it what would what would matter is if there&amp;#39;s a lot of ultraviolet light which would be when the sun is high and for people who are skin sensitive that could be an issue but if you&amp;#39;re covering up it doesn&amp;#39;t matter and here&amp;#39;s the issue the issue is is that when you need it the most in the winter time is when it&amp;#39;s the hardest to get so you really have to make a concerted effort and for a lot of people and this is this is what happens probably right after November and probably going through to mid January is this is what happens people get up in the morning they go to their car they get into their car they drive to work the sun&amp;#39;s not up yet they get to their work the sun comes up but they&amp;#39;re inside then what happens is they get done with work the sun is already down they come home from work and so there literally is weeks on end that occur where they&amp;#39;re not even getting 15 minutes of sunlight and I think this is the reason why we have the influenza surge at this time uh if you look to see the EPA did a study and they looked at Americans 93% of our time is spent inside 86 inside a building 6 to 7% inside of a vehicle and this is a relatively new thing I mean certainly when I was growing up yeah if I came home and had a snack after school I was getting kicked out of the house to go outside you know it was it was uh routine for parents to tell kids they had to go outside yeah and I think there&amp;#39;s also um it&amp;#39;s also the case as you mentioned that um we&amp;#39;re working later or at least on devices later into the evening yeah which means there&amp;#39;s more exposure to short wavelength light from devices and artificial sources absolutely absolutely so my recommendation which is what the original question was is take your lunch break outside it&amp;#39;s something as simple as getting outside even if it&amp;#39;s at lunchtime yes the ultraviolet is probably the highest at that point but if that&amp;#39;s the only time that you&amp;#39;re going to get sunlight take it now for
