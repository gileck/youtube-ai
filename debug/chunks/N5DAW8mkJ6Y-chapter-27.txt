# [03:00:43] Smell Loss Recovery

beneficial yeah I would imagine that pretty much everything that you shared with us today would be benefit icial my understanding is that some of the heterogeneity of even just the covid response in various people who got it in addition to the heterogenity and long covid symptoms could be due to the fact that the distribution of A2 receptors is very widespread in the body yeah um SARS K2 uh binds to the A2 receptor um it&amp;#39;s the primary receptor site is I understand yeah um and you know I remember early in the pandemic um asking on social media are there A2 receptors in the brain and on neurons and people are like no there&amp;#39;s no A2 receptor turns out the olfactory uh thefactory neurons are chocka block through full of uh A2 receptor and they are bonafied uh CNS neurons um their brain neurons um and so and and you lose them fortunately those can replenish over time in an activity dependent way but yeah when I hear that some people you know got covid and it was no big deal other people got covid and um they felt like they had brain fog for six months and are still coping with it probably has to do with the extent to which the virus was able to bind to A2 receptors in one person&amp;#39;s brain versus someone else maybe their bloodb brain barrier you know it didn&amp;#39;t get in there at all right yeah as I recall from the um from the and this is actually kind of interesting about olfactory is that the Nerf cells that are next to those neurons in the AL Factory are the ones that have a lot of A2 receptors and and that&amp;#39;s so what happen is these Nur supporting cells that were helping with the you know whatever they do to support the neurons were dying off and that&amp;#39;s why they were losing a sense of smell and so when the nurse cells came back and replenished people didn&amp;#39;t smell exactly the same because it when isn&amp;#39;t exactly in the same uh didn&amp;#39;t come back in the same way there was uh and this has been used for years in in air nose and throat circles is uh something as as this sounds kind of silly but smelling sticks there&amp;#39;s actually a protocol that is used that these Mar markers that are manufactured in Europe where they have a different uh different orange lemon chocolate exactly and and smelling these things uh actually over there&amp;#39;s a randomized crossover Placebo control trial that actually showed that they were able to regain their sense of smell by training their sense of smell with these sticks it makes sense because the olfactory neurons are replenished not just regenerate but they turn over um in an activity dependent way and so it requires electrical activity and their electrical activity is dictated by smell um in it and so certain clusters of olfactory neurons and the Brain neurons that they connect to or reconnect to in this case are going to be activated by different smells and so the the smell training based protocols for bringing your sense of smell back um uh uh intentionally includes a variety of smells you don&amp;#39;t just want to smell lemon you want to smell lemon coffee this um people always say do I need foul smells too in in kind of in and kind of unfortunate way um the neurons that detect noxious odors and bad odors um tend to not die off as readily but it makes sense because those are the the cells that actually preserve your um innate uh aversion reflex right they&amp;#39;re the ones that can you know our ability to detect smoke in the air something very relevant to the recent history here in LA or uh ammonia you know things that are potentially hazardous for us is are the detection thresholds are incred ibly low we&amp;#39;re just so sensitive this like the fifth cranial nerve isn&amp;#39;t it that does that uh uh well yeah so the trigeminal um will you know it it&amp;#39;s involved in some of the protection of the the nasal epithelium and and whatnot but these are the this is a direct line through um the olfactory Pathway to the amydala a fairly direct line that&amp;#39;s right it bypasses the thalamus right so right all of olfaction bypasses the thalmus but the but the learning of odors is um your odor maps are going to be slight than mine based on your experience but when it comes to the representation of smoke vomit feces and and and rotting bodies all the dangerous stuff yeah um our our Pathways look pretty similar got it got it to be to be blunt um given your expertise in lungs and
