# [00:31:35] Infrared Light, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Disease

kind of thing um incredible yeah so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s actually look at some data so we&amp;#39;ve talked about you know any astute person listening to this is like okay so you talked about a lot of observational stuff is there any Interventional stuff so I I uh turned to Glenn Jeffrey who&amp;#39;s um he&amp;#39;s in the department of Opthalmology you you know him well actually at uh University College London and he&amp;#39;s done some really interesting experiments in the last two to three years looking at red light one of them was uh the first one he did was he took um older subjects who had difficulty with color sensitivity in their vision and he exposed them to 670 nanometer which is red it&amp;#39;s visible light for just three minutes in the morning it only worked in the morning in this case which is interesting and he showed that there was a 177% increase in color sensitivity that lasted for days now why would that be again you should know that the retina is the the one tissue in the human body that has the highest concentration of mitochondria and if you understand what&amp;#39;s going on in light and I know you do but our audience might not is when you have visible light coming in to the retina it is causing a photochemical reaction that requires a tremendous amount of energy vesicles budding off things uh diffusing electrical conductions and it has to happen very very quickly otherwise what you see is going to be there as a blur so this is constantly being updated so it&amp;#39;s no surprise that you know mitochondria is so uh concentrated there so what&amp;#39;s actually going on there what we believe is going on is that this red light is actually stimulating these mitochondria to produce more ATP and it&amp;#39;s improving the sensitivity but the the the cord or the the Pella resistance was his next study which he did where he took 30 subjects he gave them 75 gram of glucose and in a blinded way so they couldn&amp;#39;t tell what was if the light was on or off he exposed their backs to the same 670 nanometer lights and he he monitored their glucose over time uh over the next two hours basically multiple points and what did he find he found that those that were exposed to red light and didn&amp;#39;t know it had lower glucose concentrations so he surmised that the mitochondria were working more efficiently they were using up more energy and this is the reason why the glucose didn&amp;#39;t Peak as high but he couldn&amp;#39;t be sure unless he also monitored for the output of metabolism so what happens when the mitochondria is working it&amp;#39;s making carbon dioxide so he also measured carbon dioxide and sure enough those subjects that had the intervention of the red light had statistically significantly higher carbon dioxide levels on exhalation awesome too bad the guys in England that&amp;#39;s a joke about for my British friends uh yeah it tends to be very overcast there but the does come out in England as well so so here we have basically this is a randomized controlled intervention trial which showed that red light&amp;#39;s doing this and there&amp;#39;s a whole host of other uh other trials that show the same thing so when I started to see this in my patients and and what caused me to even do this you might ask what&amp;#39;s a pulmonary Critical Care doc talking about mitochondria in the eye what really spur me on to look at this was when I was in the middle of something called the co pandemic and I was seeing patients in my IU that were that were dying and what were they dying of covid but what were they in there for they had things like diabetes hypertension dementia um all of these things which have at the root of them mitochondrial dysfunction so what we have is is an epidemic I believe of mitochondrial dysfunction and how are we going to repair that I think sunlight is one of the ways to do it so I started looking around at the evidence um there was a study that was done Oxford and the University of leadon in the Netherlands where they looked at about 10,000 subjects they just drew their blood and they said let&amp;#39;s just check triglycerides and insulin sensitivity and then what they did was they looked over the previous 10 days at the weather report and they were able to show that by the hour the more sunlight that there was in the previous seven days that actually predicted an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in triglycerides that fast over a 7-Day period of time there was another study that was done this was in Sweden uh so this was an epidemiological study but maybe actually showed some causation they looked at Swedish women it was about 30,000 Swedish women living in uh Sweden at the time of course and they divided them into three groups those that avoided the sun those that got moderate sun exposure and those that got a lot of sun exposure Ure and what they showed after following them for 20 years so a long period of time was that those women that were out in the sun not only had lower all cause mortality but they also had lower cardiovascular mortality and what&amp;#39;s really interesting is they had lower cancer mortality and it was in a dose response curve which suggests Bradford Hill criteria that there was maybe some causation here what was really interesting about that study is that they looked at smoking so what was the difference here it wasn&amp;#39;t a small difference it was actually such a large difference that the sunlight made that they were able to show that those women in Sweden who were in this study who went out into the sun avidly and smoked had the same mortality as those women who avoided the Sun and didn&amp;#39;t smoke the first thing that hit my mind was is what do we what do we do to people here in this country that want to smoke we tell them to go outside I&amp;#39;m not encouraging people to smoke clearly the best outcomes are going to be from not smoking um and from getting sunlight but it is a remarkable study I mean this is certainly I smoking would be under the te for temperance that would be where I would put a new start we we would not want to do that but it that same study was repeated basically again University of Edinburgh they did a biobank study 10 times the amount of people 400,000 repeated the study showed exactly the same both men and women uh except this time they actually measured UVA so they used uh ultraviolet a radiation as a surrogate for infrared and for sunlight in general they found exactly the same thing reduction in mortality such so is the evidence that even dermatologists are starting to rethink there was an article that was published in the journal of investigative Dermatology by Richard Weller and uh the name of that article was published last year it was titled uh sunlight time for a rethink and he said look there are societies that are seeing this and they&amp;#39;re already saying that there&amp;#39;s a potential benefit for getting out into the sun yeah the um
