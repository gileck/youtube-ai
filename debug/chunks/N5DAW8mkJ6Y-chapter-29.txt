# [03:11:46] Trust, Spirituality, Community, Faith; Forgiveness

chemical again let&amp;#39;s talk about the T in New Start trust yeah you talked about higher power you talked about Community you talked about connection generally and specifically um you know I&amp;#39;ve always been struck by how the belief system can impact our physical health we recently had Dr Ellen Langer on the podcast from Harvard who&amp;#39;s done incredible studies really about how beliefs can shape our phys physical health in any number of different ways um what is your clinical observation of people who are ill severely ill mildly ill and the role that trust in you know fill in the blank um you can fill in the blank has in terms of the severity of their symptoms and the rate at which they recover and hopefully they do recover yeah they do um some of the times sometimes they don&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t help that but um you do do the best that we can no it does help uh quite a bit so people who have a a a um a network people that have uh Faith people that have Community have that um that strength that allows them to get through uh those those very difficult times there there&amp;#39;s been a number of studies that have have looked at this you think that this area is kind of nebulous and hard to study now there&amp;#39;s actually some some pretty good data on this and uh I think back to a number of studies that have been done and where they looked at thankfulness and the the the Mind Body Connection people who are more thankful um have less um sematic complaints for instance than those that are not so they actually did an experiment where they had people write out letters they thought about some mentors in their past and they wrote out letters to thank them and it and it was interesting because not all of the people that wrote the letters were able to actually deliver those letters to those recipients but it didn&amp;#39;t matter what they found in the study was just simply the thought of of writing out those letters actually had a a change in the end points in those studies there was another study that was done that that was very um telling to me it was a survey that was done of 1500 people it was published out of of Texas in this particular case they wanted to limit the population of of the uh of the recipients so these were just Christians in this case uh just because of the um the heterogenity they want to see if they can get an endpoint and what they did was they looked at they asked people in this survey um how do you forgive forgiveness has to do a little bit about faith and and Trust as well and there was basically two major types of forgiveness there was forgiveness that was conditional and there was forgiveness that was unconditional and what I mean by that is is that you know people that would forgive conditionally would be if someone did something to somebody they might forgive them if they came back and apologized or they showed some sort of remorse those are the people that forgave conditionally the other people people who forgave unconditionally were the ones that would just forgive regardless of what that other person would do they would just forgive them and it would be off their mind they would just go on their way what they found was really interesting between those two populations now this was an associative study but they found that when they looked at uh anxiety at the end of life uh in terms of anxiety in terms of dying uh well-being somato sensory complaints um all sorts of a whole list of of different things they found that people who for gave conditionally the ones that would wait for someone to come back to them had higher marks in those in those cases in other words they had more anxiety they had more somato complaints um they were less feeling of well-being and so they found that that was really interesting well they didn&amp;#39;t stop there they wanted to figure out what was going on and they asked the question okay well what is the biggest determinate that determines whether or not somebody forgives conditionally versus uncondition Al and I think the odds ratio on this statement was like a two or three which is it&amp;#39;s getting up there it&amp;#39;s almost it&amp;#39;s almost you could say that the likelihood ratios are high enough to say causation but not quite but it was high and it came down to this statement and the and the and the statement was do you feel like you have been forgiven by God if they felt like they were forgiven by God they were much more likely to forgive unconditionally if they had ever felt that they were forgiven by if they feel like they were forgiven by God yes for whatever it was that they had done so this was really interesting to me because I often times I will have patients in my Intensive Care Unit who are very anxious they know that I mean anybody who gets admitted to the hospital starts to think about the mortality just imagine if you get admitted to the Intensive Care Unit A lot of my patients are not able to communicate they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re mentally out but there are a few that can and those you can tell become very anxious so this is an area that I have to sort of delicately ask about because you don&amp;#39;t know people&amp;#39;s Faith structure you don&amp;#39;t know who they are um I&amp;#39;m a I&amp;#39;m a graduate of Lind University and and our motto um and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a Christian institution is is to make man whole and part of that is not just the physical not just the mental but also the spiritual aspect of that so we make no no excuses about that but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s important to also understand that not everybody wants to have a spiritual component to their care so you have to approach it in a way that you&amp;#39;re almost do give me permission to do this and you have to watch for things it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do but you want to help if someone wants to be helped so often times I will I will talk to them about this very issue and I will say you know is there something on your mind that you need to get off your chest you would be surprised about how many times people have this issue it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;ve done something at some to somebody in their past and they don&amp;#39;t feel like they&amp;#39;re forgiven and if you have the opportunity to do that to actually give them that ability in their in their belief structure to tell them that they are forgiven it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a world of difference and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s quite it&amp;#39;s quite actually it&amp;#39;s quite amazing it&amp;#39;s interesting to me that uh in all hospitals not just hospitals with a uh you know an affiliation to a particular branch of religion uh you have chaplain yeah uh you have different um people Associated often with different religions that people can call upon which I find amazing right in this in this quote unquote modern time I mean you know of modern medicine right as far as I know every major hospital has this doesn&amp;#39;t matter how Cutting Edge or how small a community hospital which by the way many Community Hospitals are excellent should point that out the words Community Hospital ju opposed to you know cuttingedge research institution you know there&amp;#39;s actually a debate as to like which one you would prefer to go to depending on on your needs but they all have um generally as far as I know have um access to uh people um with whom patients and family of patients and Friends of patients can pray and um I that&amp;#39;s not a coincidence I think that there&amp;#39;s a deep understanding of of the of some sort of relationship there um and certainly there&amp;#39;s good science to support everything you just said um and your clinical experience in my mind goes um along with that you know science as you said is very reductionist right but people in two groups one prayes one doesn&amp;#39;t you know that&amp;#39;s sort of that&amp;#39;s the way science is done course but ultimately um the the real world clinical implications are are what um what really resonates so thank you thank you for that I have one final question
