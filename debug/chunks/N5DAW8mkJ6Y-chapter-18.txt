# [01:58:25] Cold Hydrotherapy, Vasoconstriction \u0026 White Blood Cells

but it gets to the same mechanism yeah uh so when when you say um the use of water in this context it&amp;#39;s really about trying to heat up the core temperature of the body exactly okay and so when we think about Russian Bas uh which I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of you know there&amp;#39;s some a bunch of them in different cities um whenever I&amp;#39;m in New York I go to this place down on Wall Street Spa 88 um I have no relation to them and they have a medium hot sauna for Russians medium hot as very hot it&amp;#39;s like a spice for uh in in certain restaurants you know you have to calibrate to the the the uh the local ethnicity um and then they have very hot sauna and what they do there even when they&amp;#39;re not sick is they&amp;#39;ll go from you know moderately hot to hot to um Steam and then back to hot hot SAA then into cold water so they&amp;#39;re doing heat cold contrast therapy and they and you know the Eastern Europeans and Russians have been and Scandinavians have been doing this for centuries absolutely right here we think of it is like biohacking and this new new domain of Health but this has been going on for a very long time so in my mind anthropologically I&amp;#39;m wondering those cultures that don&amp;#39;t have access to the sunlight that we have here maybe they use this as a way of supplementing that CU we don&amp;#39;t see in Winter right so we don&amp;#39;t see that we don&amp;#39;t see a lot of sauna use near the equator in any kind of culture yeah I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m sure they exist down there but I feel like um Brazil in the summertime probably feels like a sauna so you don&amp;#39;t need a SA right right whereas Siberia in Winter feels a lot like the way I imagine Siberia in Winter if you look at probably the biggest purveyor of this type of therapy that we&amp;#39;re talking about hydrotherapy was at the Battle Creek sanitarium in Battle Creek Michigan and they had whole protocols for this and when I looked it up the general protocol for this was 20 minutes of hot followed by a very very short probably Le a minute of cold that involves some sort of physical rubbing or or sort of um abrasion on the chest okay and and when I saw that it&amp;#39;s like I immediately thought of what they do in Finland and where they where they hit themselves with yeah the the um the Russians use these eucalyptus branches eucalyptus and it&amp;#39;s the um it is it&amp;#39;s eucalyptus branches I call it I think it&amp;#39;s called platza or something like that yeah um and uh yeah it costs a little bit more but if you go to one of these Russian Bas you could pay someone who&amp;#39;s skilled in this they make basically make you lie down you cover your face and and groin and then they they hit you with these uh eucalyptus branches not not to smack you with them but to now the idea is that in the sauna you&amp;#39;re going to bring some of the um uh additional Vasa dilation to the to the uh surface of the skin so you&amp;#39;re getting more blood flow to the periphery is the idea I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s any truth to it but um my understanding from what I&amp;#39;ve heard and read is that um obviously the heat part is to heal up the core body temperature and that has a whole host of of uh of responses which I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll touch on after this that I I read a recent article that was just amazing but the the cold part of it is going to cause vasil constriction and we know this in medicine we&amp;#39;re actually taught this in medical school that a cold shower Vasa constriction causes demargination of the white blood cells that are actually attached to the inside of your blood vessels and it knocks them into circulation so if you think about this what what is it that you&amp;#39;re doing with you&amp;#39;re doing the heat aspect and the fever goes up and the temperature is is basically a it&amp;#39;s a non hormonal signal to the entire body to start up up uh regulation and transcription and then the very last thing is the cold now what does that do number one it knocks those cells into circulation to go wherever they need to go that&amp;#39;s number one and number two vas of constriction peripherally which is what you will see prevents that heat that you&amp;#39;ve just built up from going out to the periphery and and being lost so it kind of locks the heat in in a sense allowing that heat to last longer amazing could you just repeat one more time even though you said it incredibly clearly yeah um this uh this phenomenon of of how the uh white blood cells are liberated by by cold and constriction yeah so when you have imagine a a tube that&amp;#39;s lined with white blood cells they all have little poyes little things that attach and what happens when you have Vasa constriction is it causes Vasa constriction it shrinks down because of the smooth muscle muscle in the wall and you have release of these white blood cells into the circulation um and that&amp;#39;s called demargination so after a cold shower you will actually be able to see and this is kind of a trick question does one&amp;#39;s white blood cell count go up after a a cold shower the answer is technically you have the same number of white cells but now they&amp;#39;re just more of them in the circulation so yes the number that you get back on the Lab Test shows that it&amp;#39;s gone up and the white blood cells for those that aren&amp;#39;t familiar they go out yeah these are the these are the macras the neutr these are all different branches if you will of the Arm Forces of your body that go out to try to find things and neutralize them and this is part of the innate immune response this is not so both actually white blood cells right on white blood cells are involved in the the Adaptive IM immune response as well amazing I&amp;#39;ve never heard of um deliberate cold exposure being used to liberate uh white blood cells in that way but it makes perfect sense it sounds like it&amp;#39;s largely mechanical it it is um and it also may seem to be mechanical in terms of locking that heat in so um one of the things that I that I always was puzzled about is I&amp;#39;ve I don&amp;#39;t know how many people are able to really get their core body temperature up to 102.2 I mean it&amp;#39;s possible you&amp;#39;d have to really try to do it and then I came across a paper that was incredible and this was a paper where they actually looked at mice which by the way I looked this up they actually have the same Target temperatures that humans have and also ham ERS and again the same Target temperature and what they showed in this they looked at the inate immune system and the signaling that&amp;#39;s required for the secretion of interferon and they looked at stat and Jack these were the two um areas or signaling and what they showed was essentially that whereas before I had told you that you had to go up to 39Â° Celsius to get a 10-fold increase in interferon secretion what they did was they looked at 36 37 38 and 39 and they saw a jump going from 37 to 38 so in other words at 38 degrees which is only 100.4 Fahrenheits there was a dramatic increase in in the signaling in probably six or seven different areas of the stat and the Jack system uh signaling when they did further analysis they said what what&amp;#39;s going on here is it is it the lack of breakdown of mRNA what what&amp;#39;s actually happening this is the clusion that they came to after they did all the molecular studies it was simply the just the increase in temperature that was causing an increase in transcription in the nucleus transcription of of of the proteins leading to more interferon correct so these we&amp;#39;re talking about not the transcription of the protein interferon but the transcription of the factors that regulate the increase in interferon yeah so it was basically transcription in the nucleus is actually upregulated itself by nothing else other than temperature I love it uh one thing that people might want to play with a little bit although they should be careful right if you&amp;#39;re pregnant forget the sauna for a while um you know if you&amp;#39;re absolutely you know everyone has different thresholds for heat tolerance and cold tolerance but uh spend a little time in a Russian B and you&amp;#39;ll soon realize that they all wear these uh like wool hats yes and you might think oh well that&amp;#39;s just going to heat you up more no it insulates you against the Heat and so you can stay in much longer because the signal to get out like that it&amp;#39;s too that it&amp;#39;s quotquot tooo hot is a is a brain signal first oh wow which makes sense right your brain basically evokes something um analogous to the gasp reflex when you&amp;#39;re not getting enough oxygen right okay so if you go in there with a with a towel on your head or or you cover your head what you find is that you can sit comfortably at much hotter temperatures than the sauna got it that could be a problem right because you don&amp;#39;t want to burn your skin but the sauna actually provides a lot more um degrees of freedom exploration safely then does hot bath because if you get into a bath that&amp;#39;s truly too hot you&amp;#39;ll burn your skin correct right whereas in the sauna you know you might go into a very hot sauna I&amp;#39;m very heat tolerant I don&amp;#39;t like the cold so much but I do it anyway but I&amp;#39;m very heat tolerant and but when I first hit a um you know a 210 degree sauna which is very very warm sauna um if you if your head isn&amp;#39;t covered your heart starts racing you feel like you want out of there if you go in there wearing a like a wool beanie cap yeah you like you&amp;#39;re fine yeah yeah you&amp;#39;re fine because the the brain signal does doesn&amp;#39;t get kicked off for a while so so that&amp;#39;s interesting because I&amp;#39;ve seen some old photographs of when they used to do this like in mass in the big hospitals back East 100 years ago and there was these treatment rooms and each of the treatment rooms had a little hole in not a little hole but a hole enough to put your head and so it was it was kind of funny because you saw this long hallway and all of these humans heads kind of sticking out of a hole while the treatment was going on inside the room their heads were outside the room you know it&amp;#39;s so amazing how humans um find the same Solutions through different portals I&amp;#39;m fascinated by this you know every once in a while I sit back from the information that we touch on in this podcast since we launched in 2021 and I think you know there are so many different tools and protocols and um and you&amp;#39;re providing additional ones today they almost all fall into about six to 10 batches and whether one comes through the the portal of traditional Western medicine or Eastern medicine or what the you know fins or the Russians do it&amp;#39;s so interesting that you know we&amp;#39;re talking light yeah temperature and these things obviously relate um hydration which I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll talk about um mitochondria cellular metabolism I mean that you know there&amp;#39;s there isn&amp;#39;t an infinite number of conceptual themes and they tend to sort of batch into them and I think understanding those themes helps people make decisions like if you&amp;#39;re on the road and you&amp;#39;re feeling run down after getting off the plane and you&amp;#39;re thinking you might be coming down with something you get that little throat tickle mhm you know you only have access to a hot shower that that&amp;#39;s your best bet do that like you don&amp;#39;t need a sauna ideally you&amp;#39;re getting sunlight you don&amp;#39;t have sunlight you can you know take some of the other measures that we were talking about before um yeah I find it fascinating that humans eventually Converge on the same answers it just sort of varies in terms of what you call these things exactly you call it hydrotherapy I call deliberate heat exposure deliberate cold exposure if you&amp;#39;re you know in some cases and people from all over the world in different cultures have talked to me in Asia in the Middle East and they say you know what my grandmother my mother they used to do this to us all the time they put us in the hot sand I remember someone telling me from from Iraq they said if we were hot if we were sick they would put us into the hot sand to heat us up and then you you talk to somebody you know from the 1950s uh Grandma&amp;#39;s say oh they put us to bed and and make sure we&amp;#39;re all warm with the covers and hot water bottle hot water bottle exactly I mean in Asia they would do something uh different i&amp;#39; I&amp;#39;ve heard them tell it it&amp;#39;s interesting to me how all of these cultures that really haven&amp;#39;t connected necessarily have come up with the same answers for for a lot of these things that said um there are things
