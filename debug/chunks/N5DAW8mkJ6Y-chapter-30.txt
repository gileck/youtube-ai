# [03:19:46] Hospital Admission, Tool: Asking Questions

you for that I have one final question yeah and and it might get you in trouble okay but I&amp;#39;m gonna ask anyway um let&amp;#39;s say I or someone that I care about is admitted to the hospital what are the things to do or ask that were not told that can facilitate better care that are within bounds now I will go on record since these days I&amp;#39;m in the habit of just kind of saying it all um I&amp;#39;m aware that families of donors to hospitals get special care this is I will just tell you there you go to a hospital there&amp;#39;s a Code language I happen to know it for several hospitals um there&amp;#39;s a Code language of this is a quote unquote special patient this will anger some listeners but it&amp;#39;s true this is the way the world works not only some listeners but some Physicians some Physicians too right so that there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a CO there&amp;#39;s a Code language that differs by hospital and and I know it for several hospitals and um um I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s one of the more complicated aspects of medicine in hospital as businesses and things like that yeah um I&amp;#39;m going to get some angry calls about this now the point of asking this is that most people are not donors to hospitals they&amp;#39;re not going to um be flagged as a special patient that gets the room with the window that gets sunlight in the morning that gets the room alone without somebody next to them who&amp;#39;s coughing all night um and on and on so Are there specific things that people should mention or ask for in order to get the best possible care when um admitted to a hospital sorry I got to put you on the spot no this is this is excellent this is an excellent question um some of the things you can control some of the things you can&amp;#39;t control getting a bed is is just completely out of your controls if you&amp;#39;re in the emergency room uh you can ask when you&amp;#39;re going to go upstairs you&amp;#39;ll get to get you&amp;#39;re going to get a bed when there&amp;#39;s going to be a bed and sometimes I can&amp;#39;t even get patients upstairs so they&amp;#39;re triaging right they&amp;#39;re this one this person is at risk of dying yes this person is miserable right and you&amp;#39;re less miserable you&amp;#39;re going to wait is that how it works okay potentially I think in terms of in terms of where you are in the hospital and the Great and the care that you&amp;#39;re going to get I believe that the number one thing that you can do to make sure that you&amp;#39;re getting the appropriate care is to in as many ways as possible communicate to The Physician usually not directly that you are familiar with the disease that the patient is being admitted for and you&amp;#39;re going to ask some tough questions um yelling yelling at the nurse uh is not going to help you um saying insulting things to the nurse or the doctor the staff is not going to help you it&amp;#39;s going to make things worse I think the number one way and I can tell you that in terms of as me as a physician if I&amp;#39;m speaking to a patient and we have a family member that is asking me intelligent questions about something that&amp;#39;s going to put me up on my game that&amp;#39;s going to make sure that I know I&amp;#39;m going to be ready for Rounds because you&amp;#39;re not going to be glossing over things they&amp;#39;re going to be asking some tough questions I got to know what I&amp;#39;m doing and and that&amp;#39;s kind of what um I I&amp;#39;ve been doing for the last 10 years 12 years in terms of uh of the teaching that I do we have a a website called medcram.com where we put up you know if you get a like you go to your doctor and you get a CBC back right how do you interpret that c CBC can you explain CBC to people CBC is a complete blood count and it&amp;#39;s the blood test that you get back when you get your blood test there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a metabolic panel that you get back how do you know what&amp;#39;s going on with the things um what about a EKG you know you have these smart watches that can actually measure your your heart rate how can you interpret what&amp;#39;s going on there we&amp;#39;ve put courses together to educate people we even have courses on diseases uh congestive heart failure what what kind of questions do you need to ask in congestive heart failure what are the things that you need to watch out for what are the medicines they&amp;#39;re going to put you on what are the side effects of those medicines um I think if and you don&amp;#39;t have to be that educated actually or even know that much but if you can show that you&amp;#39;re ask asking the right questions to a physician they&amp;#39;re going to ask you are you in the medical field you&amp;#39;re like no I just know about this disease and I have these questions about when are you going to start to do this when are you going to start to do this when is this happening and when&amp;#39;s the ne I think that more than anything puts those people who are taking care of you on alert to know that you&amp;#39;re intelligent you&amp;#39;re going to be asking some questions and they&amp;#39;re going to need to make sure that they focus on and answering those questions effectively I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the number one thing I love it and thank you for stepping right in the line of fire with that one not trying to dodge it so it speaks to uh the kind of person you are it speaks to uh the spirit behind your work which is so clearly in service to helping people you know it&amp;#39;s such a cliche thing we hear you know helping people I want to help people but it&amp;#39;s very clear that you want to help people you do this in your social media you do this through your um uh online teaching we&amp;#39;ll by the way provide links to all these um sources and you&amp;#39;re doing this in so many ways and of course in your clinical practice and you know for all those reasons and also for coming here today to take time out of your very busy professional and Family schedule and you have your own self-care right if you&amp;#39;re not healthy you can&amp;#39;t take care of other people&amp;#39;s Health right um I just want to say on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching thank you so much I learned a ton and I know everyone else listening did as well it&amp;#39;s all actionable in service to basic health and improving health and in service to avoiding illness those are not the same thing necessarily although they go hand inand and to moving through illness should one um contract a an infection and you know just a treasure Trove of knowledge so thank you so much I&amp;#39;d love to have you back again I would love to come back I look forward to seeing you online but um even more so in person so uh thank you so much Dr schwell
