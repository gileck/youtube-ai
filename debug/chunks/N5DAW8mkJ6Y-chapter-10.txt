# [00:55:18] Infrared Lamps?, Winter Sunlight Exposure; Obesity \u0026 Metabolic Dysfunction

going to get sunlight take it now for some you know we can say this I can say this I live in Southern California I&amp;#39;m blessed by 300 and some odd days of sunlight every year what do you do you do when you&amp;#39;re in Boston what do you do if you&amp;#39;re in New York what if you do if you&amp;#39;re in England in Sweden and these places where there isn&amp;#39;t a lot of light well there&amp;#39;s a study that was done looking at infrared lamps right so you&amp;#39;ve got to be careful there because if the infrared lamps are too high in amplitude this result from infrared light in the body is something known as a basic response and that&amp;#39;s really important to understand don&amp;#39;t come into this if you&amp;#39;re going to get a red light therapy and think that more is better because more may not be better um you actually could do detriment if you have the red light at too high of a level so I would match it to what we&amp;#39;re getting from the Sun as you said the sunlight is your best infrared or red lamp so there was a study that was done looking at well-being and they did a red lamp Red Light lamp infrared light so it was coupled with 850 I think was the nanometer so that is definitely in the infrared Spectrum can&amp;#39;t see that cannot see it and they had it set up at a desk that some guy was sitting in front of for 4 hours a day for 8 weeks and they did the study and they they did it in the summertime and they did it in the winter time and this is really telling there was no effect on the subject when they looked at those that had it in the summertime I would say probably because they were getting plenty of infrared light elsewhere it was only they only showed a statistically significant effect in the wintertime and so if you look at influenza I would even go beyond that look at a chart of the United States throughout the entire year and look at all of the natural causes of death not just influenza and pneumonia look at cardiac disease look at look at uh kidney disease Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease all of those deaths go up all at the same time and they all go up about 1 to 3 weeks after the shortest day of the year and they all come down and they all are at the nator about 1 to 3 weeks after the longest day of the year when you see that and you you just start to just digest what you&amp;#39;re seeing there and then you start to understand that infrared light from the sun which we have filtered out with LEDs and all this we can get to that all of that&amp;#39;s gone that we&amp;#39;re spending 93% of our our time indoors put that all together and the fact that infrared light helps the mitochondria and the fact that the mitochondria is at the sort of the core of all of these chronic diseases that we&amp;#39;re battling it it it really wakes you up and you start to realize that maybe the lowest hanging fruit that we can do right now today for literally no money is simply to just work on getting more sun exposure in the winter time two questions one um it&amp;#39;s hard to attach a single number to this but uh what fraction of the Obesity epidemic that we observe in the United States do you think um is caused by altered interactions with sunlight or you know artificial light and its consequences or put differently let let me put it let me phrase the question differently If This Were if we were designing an experiment and I wanted to wager the hypothesis that exposure to 15 minutes a day of sunlight could help reduce um you know adapost tissue Etc independent of caloric intake I know this is kind of a heretical idea yeah independent of additional exercise and all that and I designed the experiment with you and we said okay people are going to go outside for 15 minutes a day they&amp;#39;re going to wear short sleeves if they can or just simple long sleeve clothing they&amp;#39;re going to get this long wavelength light from the sun 15 minutes a day yeah based on what you told us about the the light shown on the back and the lowered glucose response yes independent of all other variables what percentage Improvement in um uh sort of the overall all metrics of obesity and metabolic disease do you think we you would predict if we were just going to you know we bet a sushi dinner for instance you know I guess another way of asking the question is is at what level would I be really surp if it was 50% I would be surprised right same yeah if it was 20 to 30% I think that would probably be where it is but that&amp;#39;s significant that&amp;#39;s still significant okay so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very helpful um I
