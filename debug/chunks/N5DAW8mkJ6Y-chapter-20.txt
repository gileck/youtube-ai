# [02:19:28] Tool: NAC Dose \u0026 Regimen; Mucous, Flu Symptoms

them off I see so I started taking Knack at I think at 600 milligrams or even 900 milligrams three to four times per day which is a very high dose yeah but restricted to times when I felt like I might be coming down with an infection or I was traveling um in the winter months I still do this or if I had any kind of um low-level congestion and uh my understanding is that it&amp;#39;s a mucolytic yes because mu mucus again the reason why mucus is so thick is because of those SS bonds so when you put Knack in there it breaks it off and now it&amp;#39;s liquidy it&amp;#39;s used to treat cystic fibrosis and the uh to counteract the buildup of fluid in the lungs as I understand yeah um so it will make your nose run a bit if you have a little lowle congestion but what I love about it and I don&amp;#39;t have any Rel to be clear f I don&amp;#39;t have any relationship to any company that sells Knack no one I&amp;#39;m not paid by big Knack um uh or anything similar or Big Mac no or certainly not by Big Mac but um by Big Mac either um but I don&amp;#39;t like conventional decongestant I like steam um but but I don&amp;#39;t like taking over the counter decongestants of the sort of uh conventional commercial type because they tend to be very drying they sometimes have a little bit of a stimulant quality to them I I just don&amp;#39;t like them and I find that neck in addition to increasing glutathione which can only be a good thing um is a great decongestant you do have to keep blowing your nose quite a lot if you take it right before you go to sleep and you sleep on your back you can wake up like feeling more congested so you have to kind of understand what it&amp;#39;s doing that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re talking about it in this way yeah but um I I find that it&amp;#39;s helped me move through um periods of uh you know sort of exposure to uh colds maybe flu but certainly colds um much faster and actually there to support that it can prevent Contracting the flu virus well uh not necessarily Contracting it but certainly having the symptoms of it so this was a this is this is like the best study you could ever imagine right so this is a multi-centered double blinded Placebo controlled trial right so you&amp;#39;re eliminating a lot of the confounders and what they did was in a winter season so I think it was over six three to six months people were taking 600 milligrams of knack twice a day and what they did was they looked to see how many people got infected and what they&amp;#39;re symptoms were and it while it did not reduce the number of infections from influenza there was a significant reduction in the symptoms of influenza so infections no it doesn&amp;#39;t reduce but symptoms dramatically and which symptoms specifically it&amp;#39;s the most annoying symptoms so the the one that dropped the most was the runny nose and the sore throat those that was what it was best at reducing there&amp;#39;s been some question about Knack because it&amp;#39;s so it&amp;#39;s so good for cells right because it it replenishes uh there are some studies in vitro in cells that are designed to be models for cancer that that can actually cause the propensity for some of these cells to uh to um grow and and and uh expand um I think that probably needs to be taken with a little bit of grain of salt because these were in models that are designed for cancer cells to grow so the same thing would happen if you were to give nutrition to cancer cells on a p Tre dish right that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that that nutrition causes cancer right yeah you ra a really important Point around this I mean the uh the joke that was told to me years ago is you know a drug or a compound is a substance that when injected in to an animal uh creates a scientific paper meaning meaning it&amp;#39;s very easy to see things change when you add when you do a dose response curve of just about anything right um and some people might say Well thank goodness are are any compounds doing anything that are that&amp;#39;s real or is it all Placebo I think there are real effects of compounds uh the context is really important yeah um do you take Knack continuously given your job or do you uh do you increase your your dosage when you are you know you&amp;#39;re coming into contact with flu patients I do uh I do exactly as this paper was doing in a winter season when I know that things are going to be elevated and high and I&amp;#39;m going to be seeing a lot of uh influenza patients I do take 600 milligrams twice a day U but I tried not to do it for more than 3 months I don&amp;#39;t know the long-term effects but I think three months is probably good enough yeah I know people take it continuously I&amp;#39;ve never taken it continuously I I sort of enjoy the fact that there are certain compounds out there like Knack that um I personally can observe of a benefit from if I take it for short periods in slightly higher Doses and then I stop and I have the you know unfounded theory that it um it helps punctuate the the effectiveness because you&amp;#39;re not you know because there is downregulation of pretty much every mechanism you could possibly imagine right I mean there&amp;#39;s so many redundancies that are built into the system but uh in this situation I I I don&amp;#39;t know what the mechanism is but I believe that with influenza there is a um there is a a tilting of the scale toward oxidative stress and Knack in that sense can be very helpful and as I recall in the study that you described um where people took this 600 milligrams of knack twice a day the uh reduction in um what in severe symptoms or or was it the number of people that experienced severe symptoms went from somewhere in the high 70% maybe 78% or something like that I&amp;#39;m not quite um uh exact on the numbers here folks to about 28% is that right yeah so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s uh about a 50% uh absolute risk reduction which if you do the math it&amp;#39;s a number needed to treat of two which is extremely low and very amazing and you&amp;#39;re getting um and a increasing glutathione to boot so yeah wonderful um other things that have been
