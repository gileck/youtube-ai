# [01:13:21] Artificial Lights, Hospitals \u0026 Light Therapy?, ICU Psychosis

huberman to get early access to function it&amp;#39;s a spectacular story um it by any account um I wanted to just touch on the fact that there&amp;#39;s no replacement for sunlight getting patients outside is hard yeah um and at the same time most people listening to this aren&amp;#39;t fortunately are not patients of um thank goodness many people however have relatives or themselves are elderly um as people get older they tend to slow down get outside less they&amp;#39;re any uh fortunate exceptions to this but one of the setups that I created for myself um that I think is certainly feasible for a lot of people is the following uh well first of all I always make it a point to get outside and get sunlight in my eyes yeah rain or shine right um and regardless of where I&amp;#39;m traveling and uh Etc I do that every single day if I miss a day it&amp;#39;s only because of something like a like a flight where I happen to be on a plane at the time of you know sunrise or something in any but I have a setup that I um constructed for myself that is basically a 10,000 Lux light these are available I don&amp;#39;t have any relationship to 10,000 Lux light sources um those 10,000 Lux light sources tend to be short wavelength shifted they tend to be very blue they&amp;#39;re white light but I don&amp;#39;t think they have power across the visible spectrum I think they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very a red light and infrared diminish they tend to be um very blue and green light and enriched and it shows up as very bright white light so that&amp;#39;s what um I put in front of me when I first wake up if the sun isn&amp;#39;t out yet but now I&amp;#39;ve started um putting a red light near infrared light next to it and I&amp;#39;ll spend the first couple minutes of my day um usually as I journal or do something like that or sometimes just with my eyes closed just pleasantly you know uh facing in the direction of the 10,000 Lux white light and the red light near infrared light and I must say um this is anecdotal but that the combination of the two not only does it wake certainly wake you up the white light will do that alone yeah uh we know the biological basis for that but I I have noticed a a tremendous Improvement in energy mood Focus Etc that comes from the addition of this red light near infrared light this is not an advertisement for red light near infrared light I promise uh although you know I this podcast does have a relationship to a medical grade red light devices I I but I mention this because what I&amp;#39;m trying to simulate there is sunlight but I still get outside and get sunlight so I just mentioned this setup because it seems to me that hospitals should be able to create this setup it&amp;#39;s for a minimum of cost certainly less cost than it takes to maintain a patient for one day exactly I mean the cost of maintaining a patient in uh for inpatient uh care is so high medical staff the the disposables the dis the the dis the um actual disposing of the disposables the janitorial to after the ca like I mean Hospital costs are outrageously high now of course people will hear this and think well that&amp;#39;s exactly what hospitals want right like they can Char the longer you stay it&amp;#39;s like a hotel the longer that you stay the longer they can charge you or your insurance and I&amp;#39;m not a conspiracy theory type yeah but it it is interesting that for many people they associate going to a hospital with staying a long time and and getting sicker sometimes they get better and go home thank goodness you&amp;#39;re certainly a well-meaning doctor the nursing staff are well-meaning people yes put simply why don&amp;#39;t hospitals include light therapy given the abundance of data on circadian rhythms and light therapy and I&amp;#39;ll just attach one more thing my audience always gets upset at the duration of these these questions SL editorials but this is my wheelhouse this whole light thing so I can&amp;#39;t help myself there&amp;#39;s also something known as ICU psychosis absolutely which is when people who are perfectly mentally healthy go into a hospital yeah because of the relationship to light and the disruption and circadian rhythm from the overhead lights the checking of the patient in the middle of the night the disruption in sleep Etc people literally develop psychosis that resolves itself the moment they get home and get onto a normal schedule and it&amp;#39;s well known that the patients that are in a hospital bed next to a window don&amp;#39;t experience this to the same degree if at all so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of like I feel like we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re in an we&amp;#39;re sitting under an avalanche not a waterfall but an avalanche of data telling us what we need to do and like forgive me but like what the hell is going on exactly so I I can tell you that not only do you have less likely to get uh this type of ICU psychosis but the data actually shows that people who are in a tw- bed room that are next to the window actually discharge from the hospital faster and you say ah well maybe that&amp;#39;s the reason well it&amp;#39;s interesting because the financial incentives with hospitals is not monolithic some hospitals uh and their relationship to the insurance companies are at a situation where when a patient comes into the hospital and the and the physician diagnoses them the insurance will pay the hospital a certain amount of money for that diagnosis and that&amp;#39;s that and also there&amp;#39;s something called subc capita uh Arrangements where the hospital has a contract with an insurance company to take care of 30,000 people per member per month and if that patient gets admitted to the hospital that hospital has to take care of that patient whatever the costs are so it it basically takes the risk now and puts it from the insurance company onto the healthc care provider so in those situations you&amp;#39;ll see a hospital having a an army of case managers they come down every day what are we doing for this patient what do we need to do to get this patient out of the hospital so they&amp;#39;re motivated to get people out and so when I say that I&amp;#39;m even more bewildered than when you said at the beginning well if we have good data that shows that light therapy and light getting people out into the sun actually can improve the discharge we we had that as I said that study from Brazil where there was a randomized controlled trial and they used 15 minutes of they actually made this jacket that they put on the patients and they flipped it on with some patients and they didn&amp;#39;t flip it on with others they they the jacket was a light jacket it was an LED jacket that was giving light out at 940 nmet infrared light so you can&amp;#39;t even tell if it&amp;#39;s on and as I said the the the Mills per square Cen was like 2.9 so you wouldn&amp;#39;t even feel it but yet these patients when they were done 7 Days 15 minutes a day they had better oxygen saturation they could take deeper breaths longer breaths they their heart rates their their respiratory rates improved even their lymphocytes improved the the ones that are very important for fighting off covid-19 and so at the very end of all of this the average length of stay in the control group was 12 days about 12 days in the intervention group it was 8 days how much does it cost to spend 4 days in a hospital it can be outrageous outrageous and and so all and it&amp;#39;s potentially possible and this is why I think really people need to understand this not just not just people who are wanting for their own care but people who are in charge of hospitals people who are in charge of of of Health Care in this country is understanding that I believe why I&amp;#39;m happy to talk about this is I think that the lowest hanging fruit potentially after you look at that graph of deaths throughout the year is encouraging sunlight in people especially in those that are hospitalized and sick absolutely I don&amp;#39;t know why but I think if somebody were to pick up the Baton and decide to do a very simple study where you you&amp;#39;d have to hire some nurses that would actually I&amp;#39;ve actually thought about doing this the study myself is having a unit outside in the sun where people go for literally 20 to 30 minutes and they come back you have a whole bunch of nurses there with monitoring so that you can make sure the patients are stable and then you send them right back up we send people down at the cat scanner all the time it takes 15 to 20 minutes this is not something that we don&amp;#39;t do the difference is you&amp;#39;re just sending them outside hopefully it&amp;#39;s warm it&amp;#39;s not too cold you know there&amp;#39;s nothing that bad that happens and you send them right back up that would be a very easy study to do you could randomize them and then see what happens to their length of stay in my experience and it&amp;#39;s only anecdotal I have not done the study it it it&amp;#39;s a world of difference that&amp;#39;s for sick people if we&amp;#39;re thinking about health maintenance and health Improvement in healthy people who are not in the hospital which fortunately is most people it&amp;#39;s very clear 15 minutes a day of sunlight exposure uh and if you absolutely can&amp;#39;t get sunlight exposure think about um some artificial light Arrangement that might be beneficial I want to make sure that we
