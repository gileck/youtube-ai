# [00:19:09] Melatonin Antioxidant, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)/Free Radicals

the mitochondria okay I have to ask about this yes most people including me are familiar with melatonin secretion from the pineal gland correct being suppressed by light via some neural circuit Pathways that go from eye to supermatic nucleus to there there&amp;#39;s a a circuitous Loop to the you know uh the brain stem and then up uh um to the pineer so light suppresses melatonin release from the pineal we know that yes in that context melatonin is the hormone of darkness and causes sleepiness correct what is the role of melatonin in the context that you are describing because if indeed infrared and long other long wavelength light is causing the production of melatonin from the mitochondria in the rest of the body I&amp;#39;m assuming that&amp;#39;s not to increase our levels of sleepiness that is correct and I do know that melatonin is a powerful antioxidant yes so I&amp;#39;m guessing that next you&amp;#39;re going to tell me that it is combating or the reactive oxygen species that are produced as a function of mitochondrial uh metabolism absolutely okay absolutely so the the mitochondria make melatonin on site this is not being secreted into the blood it&amp;#39;s being used on site so this is not being used as a secondary Messenger to tell the body anything about circadian rhythm this is a extremely powerful as you know extremely powerful antioxidants it&amp;#39;s actually one of the most powerful antioxidants in the human body it actually upregulates the glutathione system by regulation so what this melatonin does is it&amp;#39;s able to mop up these reactive oxygen species let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s back up a little bit there reactive oxygen species what are they so if you if you let&amp;#39;s get let&amp;#39;s get nerdy let&amp;#39;s get into the details in the mitochondria the way it works is that you burn fuels you burn carbohydrates proteins and fats and as a result of that you make these very reduced agents nadh fadh2 they go to the electron transport chain and as just as the Colorado River as it goes down through various different dams and then dumps out into the Gulf of California the same thing happens with these very highly charged and electronegative electrons they as they start to fall down and get trans erred from one uh enzyme to another they cause the out out production or the out transfer of protons into the in membrane space the problem is though is when you finally get done with these electrons they&amp;#39;ve been completely spent there&amp;#39;s nothing else to accept them and the only thing that can actually do that is something so Electro negative that it would actually take these electrons and that&amp;#39;s oxygen and that&amp;#39;s the reason why we breathe oxygen it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s because we need an electron acceptor for these spent electrons it&amp;#39;s very near and dear to my heart as a pulmonologist and critical care specialist I we need to have oxygen if you don&amp;#39;t have oxygen things shut down very quickly for those that aren&amp;#39;t familiar with these biochemical Pathways maybe one way for them to think about it is that free electrons are not a good thing in this system you don&amp;#39;t want electrons floating around and in these biochemical steps that convert energy into the stuff that cells can use more readily to move and do everything that we do right electrons are kicked off oxygen can work with those free electrons I&amp;#39;m trying to use language here that you know divorces us from the from the uh you know the classic biochemical pathway so that more people can grasp it because it&amp;#39;s really a beautiful mechanism it so if you have a a positive charge to effectively work with the the free negative charge then um the system is is stabilized or at least isn&amp;#39;t pushed in in the direction of inflammation these is many people have heard of free radicals exactly and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re referring to you want to you want to offset the free radicals correct and to the biochemists out there and the biologist I&amp;#39;m using the term offset Loosely um okay so melatonin in the context of how sunlight can activate melatonin within cells maybe it&amp;#39;s um worth pointing out to people that when the pineal gland releases melatonin to make you sleepy that&amp;#39;s an endocrine or hormone type mechanism hormones act on local tissues and more distant tissues in the body corre phermones act between bodies right right in the context that you&amp;#39;re describing melatonin is acting within cell correct okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s think of the let&amp;#39;s think of this dichotomy the mitochondria always needs to have antioxidants otherwise it&amp;#39;s going to become damaged like if these free radicals are produced the very next molecule that they bump into it&amp;#39;s going to change it and if that&amp;#39;s the mitochondria the mitochondria is going to be damaged so it needs a cooling system just like your car has a cooling system for heat the mitochondria needs a cooling system for oxidative stress what&amp;#39;s the cooling system during the day sunlight comes in activates these uh it upregulates melatonin which does that well when there is no sunlight what is the cooling system then it&amp;#39;s the system that we&amp;#39;ve always known about and the reason why we&amp;#39;ve always known about it is because we can draw blood samples it&amp;#39;s much easier to detect melatonin in the blood because we&amp;#39;ve developed techniques first to detect things in the blood but what we&amp;#39;re talking about now is how do we detect things not only intracellular but intra organel that&amp;#39;s much more sophisticated yet now we do have the technology to show and the amount of melatonin we&amp;#39;re talking about is 20 times higher than we&amp;#39;re picking up in the blood so at night the system is melatonin is secreted from the pineal gland it goes into the blood diffuses into the cell diffuses into the mitochondria and does the job do you think that that role of melatonin from the pineal at night is part of the reason why sleep is so restorative absolutely it&amp;#39;s probably no coincidence then that when we fall asleep it&amp;#39;s at least correlated with and in many ways caused by the reduction in core body temperature like it&amp;#39;s very unusual for melatonin levels to be high when body temperature is high yeah these things normally are coordinated at night I&amp;#39;m not aware that it actually drops body temperature but it might I I&amp;#39;m just not aware of the literature but what you&amp;#39;re describing is amazing I mean first of all most people&amp;#39;s minds including mine are going to be blown by the fact that long wavelength light can actually go through clothing yes and skin and so you can imagine that if you have a minimum of clothing on whatever is appropriate for that context and you get some sunlight on your skin even on a cloudy day yes some of this should be coming through we could talk about that it&amp;#39;s more UV light short wavelength light that&amp;#39;s going to break through thick cloud cover correct uh cloud cover because it&amp;#39;s water vapor and water vapor does absorb infrared it will be substantially less but much more than being inside and on a clear day or partially cloudy day uh we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of red light long wavelength light and infrared and near infrared light coming through absolutely I think a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize that because in this age of of red light devices and infrared light devices um of which I own one and I love and I use um but people forget that the uh the primordial and arguably I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll say the best source of red light and near infrared light and infrared light of the sort that we&amp;#39;re talking about right now is going to come from the sun right I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no device that can replace the sun 100% okay 100% yeah okay great so how does this keep us safe from
