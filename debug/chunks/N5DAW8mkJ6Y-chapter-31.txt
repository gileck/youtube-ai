thank you so much thank you once again for joining me for today&amp;#39;s discussion with Dr Roger schwell to learn more about his work and to find links to him on social media and YouTube please see the show note captions if you&amp;#39;re learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our YouTube channel that&amp;#39;s a terrific zeroc cost way to support us in addition please click follow for the podcast on both Spotify and apple and on both Spotify and apple you can leave us up to a five-star review if you have questions for me or comments about the podcast or guests or topics you&amp;#39;d like me to consider for the hubman Lab podcast please put those in the comment section on YouTube I do read all the comments please also check out the sponsors mentioned at the beginning and throughout today&amp;#39;s episode that&amp;#39;s the best way to support this podcast for those of you that haven&amp;#39;t heard I have a new book coming out it&amp;#39;s my very first book it&amp;#39;s entitled protocols an operating manual for the human body this is a book that I&amp;#39;ve been working on for more than 5 years and that&amp;#39;s based on more than 30 years of research and experience and it covers protocols for everything from sleep to exercise to Stress Control protocols related to focus and motivation and of course I provide the scientific substantiation for the protocols that are included the book is now available by pre-sale at protocols book.com there you can find links to various vendors you can pick the one that you like best again the book is called protocols an operating manual for the human body if you&amp;#39;re not already following me on social media I am huberman lab on all social media platforms so that&amp;#39;s Instagram X formerly known as Twitter Facebook LinkedIn and threads and on all those platforms I discuss science and science related tools some of which overlaps with the content of the hubman Lab podcast but much of which is distinct from the content on the huberman Lab podcast again that&amp;#39;s hubman lab on all social media platforms and if you haven&amp;#39;t already subscribed to our neural network newsletter the neural network newsletter is a zeroc cost monthly newsletter that includes podcast summaries as well as what we call protocols in the form of one to three-page PDFs that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep how to optimize dopamine deliberate cold exposure we have a foundational Fitness protocol that covers cardiovascular training and resist distance training all of that is available completely zero cost you simply go to hubman lab.com go to the menu tab in the top right corner scroll down to news letter and enter your email and I should emphasize that we do not share your email with anybody thank you once again for joining me for today&amp;#39;s discussion with Dr Roger schwell and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science [Music]
