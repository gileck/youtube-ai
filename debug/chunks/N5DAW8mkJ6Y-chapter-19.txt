# [02:09:56] N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), Glutathione, White Clots, Flu

things that said um there are things that purportedly we can take to accelerate our progression through uh an illness should we get one uh and to help avoid illness one of the things I&amp;#39;m most interested in is uh your thoughts on maack and acetal cysteine U my understanding is that a few years ago in this country there was an FDA ban on netal cysteine but that the people who had already been taking anical cysteine were so bullish about it that they SW back and it has remained freely available without a prescription my understanding is that netal cine requires a prescription in some countries could you tell us what the various uses of an acetylcysteine are um and what its potential role is for avoiding or even accelerating the progression uh through a viral or other type of infection yeah so the an and I I sometimes say n ayine it may be just my Canadian accent coming through I&amp;#39;m guessing I oh I didn&amp;#39;t realize you&amp;#39;re a Canadian uh I&amp;#39;m guessing you are correct and I&amp;#39;m incorrect no I think you are correct cuz people have corrected me so I think if I say it if slip up that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what happens so Mom Mom you know ninth grade grade nine these are all Canadian that true yeah so so the probably the most obvious one to start with is the one that&amp;#39;s actually we use all the time in the hospital and it&amp;#39;s for Tylenol overdose and that&amp;#39;s because Tylenol uh the metabolism of Tylenol depletes the liver of these reducing agents glutathione things of that nature so um an acetal cysteine is going to replace that and that&amp;#39;s one of the things that&amp;#39;s well known we actually have dosing protocols we have nomograms to tell us when we should use it when we shouldn&amp;#39;t use it and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very well documented so it supports liver metabolism it it supports liver metabolism and prevents the liver from going into failure so people could literally die if we didn&amp;#39;t give them this medication does it also effectively treat liver failure due to other things like alcohol that&amp;#39;s a excellent question uh I would say if you ask asked me that question 20 to 25 years ago I would have said no there&amp;#39;s no evidence but now if you talk to some GI Specialists they&amp;#39;ll say yeah there&amp;#39;s some data that it it actually may be beneficial it&amp;#39;s certainly not going to hurt and so in patients who have liver failure uh from one thing or another they may actually recommend using that medication as well and estaline so Knack is a glutathione precursor is that right it is it is one that it&amp;#39;s recharging so if you want to think about it in terms of redo this is a good way to think about it is think about a um a sulfur uh element with an a hydrogen attached to it that is the reduced form because it can donate that proton off and and it&amp;#39;ll be in a reduced situation so it can reduce something that was oxidized however when it reduces something that was oxidized and it it does that in a in a good way it itself becomes oxidized and instead of having an s h it&amp;#39;s now SS so now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s oxidized that&amp;#39;s really important in a lot of places because of that SS Bond so you&amp;#39;ll know that the SS bonds occurs in in amuno acids it&amp;#39;s the reason why you&amp;#39;re you can perm your hair uh you may not know that but uh the way your hair is is because of ss bonds and then what you do is you reduce all of those SS Bonds in other words you know basically disconnecting them and then you can curl it however you want and then when you take it away those SS bonds clamp down and you have a perm all right Next Episode I&amp;#39;ll show up looking like a Chia Pet that&amp;#39;s the reason why when you go to get a perm that stuff smells like rotten eggs is because that&amp;#39;s the sulfur group yeah so um that&amp;#39;s also by the way the same reason why and this gets it a little bit other discussion about why I think Knack may be I&amp;#39;ll just call it knack uh is used in other areas is um this is also the main reason why we get thrombosis of platelets so pulmonary artery if you have the endothelial lining which makes sure that the red blood cells as they&amp;#39;re going through the pulmonary artery are not causing clots if those if that endothelial lining would become damaged it would release underneath it and expose a huge collection of something called Von willbrand Factor Von willbrand factor is a monomer but it quickly becomes a polymer and the way it does that is in forming SS bonds so that&amp;#39;s a a quick pull ization then of course the next step that happens is that these polymers will then trap platelets and cause them to Clump and you will get something called a white clot so for those that aren&amp;#39;t familiar with monomers and polymers and this kind of thing basically you&amp;#39;re taking a a bead and you&amp;#39;re creating the polymer which is more like beads on a string exactly exactly and that can capture more things like a big clumpy Mo big clumpy sticky molecules aren&amp;#39;t quote unquote bad or good but in this context they&amp;#39;re definitely bad they would be yeah so imagine now if you will uh the pulmonary artery in somebody who becomes infected with either influenza or covid-19 and that causes an oxidative stress situation where you have the cell having more oxidative stress than it should causes dysfunction of the cell the cell becomes damaged peels back releases some of the Von Willer Brands factor and now you have clots in the in the pulmonary artery this is something actually that we did see with co uh when they did the autopsies found many times more of these specific white clots in these patients and so um I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s the mechanism that&amp;#39;s occurring in influenza but there was a lot of papers that were published in Co and the interesting thing about that was is that uh do you remember when they published they they had a paper that was published looking at blood types and covid and they said you know what what we&amp;#39;re finding is is that those with type O blood are just slightly less SU suceptible to getting Co they have a slightly less mortality yeah that was a relief to me because I&amp;#39;m O blood okay yeah well the interesting thing about that is well known is that people with typo blood have slightly less Von willbrand Factor so does that mean in general that that we clot less if that clotting is related to Von will Brand&amp;#39;s Factory and platelets then yes there&amp;#39;s other ways of causing clot gen the CL clotting Cascade but yes so I found it really interesting that was kind of two independent points that sort of connected each other the other thing that was actually really interesting about this and this will lead to the conversation about Knack and why I was using it in actually patients with co9 and influenza and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that study too is is ace2 so ace2 is a receptor for the spike protein for SARS kov 2 true but let&amp;#39;s take it one step further that ace2 what is it actually there for what why is it even there it&amp;#39;s not there to be a receptor for for Spike protein the actual job that ace2 does is converts Angiotensin 2 which is a prooxidant into Angiotensin 17 which is an antioxidant so let&amp;#39;s go back to the beginning of our discussion again here&amp;#39;s the mitochondria here&amp;#39;s the the mitochondria is doing what it needs to do and it&amp;#39;s producing oxidative stress and it&amp;#39;s got all these different enzymes that are there to lessen the heat from that engine catalase glutathion peroxidase superoxide dismutase melatonin as we discussed at the beginning and Angiotensin 17 so now what happens you&amp;#39;ve got these patients that have obesity you have these patients that have cancer um heart disease dementia these are people whose engines are running hot they&amp;#39;re barely making it because of all of the oxidative stress damage that has occurred now what happens this virus comes in Spike protein hits the A2 receptor and now that thing that was in balance is now out of balance because you&amp;#39;re no longer taking a pro oxy and making an antioxidant so now the the analogy is is that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re in a car and your car the the the Heat and the engine&amp;#39;s barely I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s coming up right and you&amp;#39;re barely making it and now you approach a Hill Called covid-19 and you&amp;#39;re going up that hill you&amp;#39;re going to burn out your engine&amp;#39;s going to overheat and that&amp;#39;s what was happening with these patients remember they were coming in happy hypoxics they were calling them they were there they looked they were fine but they were they were severely um uh hypoxic what I believe what was happening and some data to show this is the case is that the as the virus went into the lungs and I believe this also happens with influenza these the virus was getting into the pulmonary circulation and as it was going down it was binding to the very rich A2 receptors and all of these pulmonary endothelial cells and it was causing these enzymes to stop working and now the oxidative balance was being knocked out these cells were becoming damaged they were peeling off Von willbrand Factor was coming into circulation and this polymerization was occurring and these white clots were occurring and that was leading to hypoxemia how do we stop that from happening well certainly one way of doing it is to make sure that the redo balance in these cells are are are maintained and one way of doing that is light and melatonin and all the things that we just talked about but another way of doing it in addition would potentially be in preventing those sulfide bonds from forming and causing polymerization and that&amp;#39;s where you have Knack which is basically it would go through to those SS bonds that are causing the polymerization and break them off I see so I started taking Knack
