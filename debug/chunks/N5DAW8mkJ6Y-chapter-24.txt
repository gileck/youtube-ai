# [02:36:49] Fresh Air, Forest Bathing, Tool: Go Outdoors

direction anyway so in terms of air we&amp;#39;ve talked about what should not be in the air but um there&amp;#39;s actually some data that&amp;#39;s really surprising that I was I found during the pandemic that was interesting to me that should be in there that maybe isn&amp;#39;t in there and that&amp;#39;s fresh air associated with going outside so what is out there in the air what should be out there obviously clean air um people who live you know next to freeways and pollution those are bad things we&amp;#39;ve talked about that but um the Japanese seem to have a corner on This research it&amp;#39;s really interesting stuff um you&amp;#39;ve heard heard of forest bathing so there was a number of studies where they&amp;#39;ve taken uh the CEOs in Tokyo and they took them up to the Hanoi Cypress forests sounds beautiful it is and um what they found was they did actually very controlled research where they checked blood levels and they they did blood tests and they had them walk around for three days in the forest uh Forest bathing and they actually took air samples and they found that there&amp;#39;s these substances called phon sides which are given off by the trees not just Hanoi Cyprus trees but just about any kind of trees so fur trees oak trees all sorts of uh pine trees and that these substances interact with our bodies and specifically again the innate immune system they were actually able to look at chromogranin a which is a a substance that&amp;#39;s in some of these white blood cells that are are you know fighting white blood cells that fight infections and they were able to show that when they were in that environment there were definite changes in the immune system toward the positive and that these changes lasted for seven days so they did another aspect of the study so there was multiple Publications that this group in Japan did they took these same guys and they took them down to a hotel in Tokyo out of the honoki Cypress forests and they infused these same fight and sites from these hoki Cyprus trees they basically took the oil from these trees and Infused it in the hotel room and they found very similar results to what they were getting out there when they were walking in the forest so that would seem to indicate that there was something that this was what was being made responsible the one difference which was interesting between when they were up there walking around in the forest and when they were down in Tokyo in the hotel room with the infuser is the urinary cortisol levels were lower when they were walking in the forest than when they were in the hotel and that&amp;#39;s as you know a symbol of basically stress so there is there is something that there is a junqua I guess the French would say there&amp;#39;s something Galt about walking in the forest that&amp;#39;s different than just infusing the Hanoi Cyprus but I I thought that was an interesting thing and it kind of goes along again with what we were talking about at the beginning when you&amp;#39;re out there in nature in the in the forestry in the green walking green spaces we have this evidence these leaves reflect a lot of infrared light which we&amp;#39;ve already talked about but there&amp;#39;s also Al something else in the equation as well and it kind of leads just a bigger picture and bigger philosophy of of life and that&amp;#39;s the reductionism of science we always trying to reduce something to an active ingredient to try to figure out what it is but there is actually something to be said for getting these things in the environment that we would normally be getting them in I think that&amp;#39;s interesting someone made the
