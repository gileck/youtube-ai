# [01:38:13] Masks?, Flu; Handwashing

risks in the winter months when flu levels are high are you wearing a mask from the moment you walk into the clinic in the morning until when you leave um when you walk up to a new patient um if you know they have a flu or if you know they don&amp;#39;t have the flu um are you masked up I mean this became a big issue around the um the covid discussion uh but to what extent is wearing a conventional um mask or even an95 actually protect you from from flu yeah so the the the regular surgical masks are very good at preventing things from coming out of your mouth and going to other people or coming onto your mouth if you happen to have one on so in our Clinic where we work we actually look at the flu incidents and then we see if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s rising everybody that comes into that place Physicians patients everybody puts a mask on to to to reduce that uh n95s are a little different in that they don&amp;#39;t prevent viruses from coming out of somebody you may notice when you put an n95 mask on they may even have a valve that pops open and and and gas can come out your respiratory air can come out or comes out the sides it&amp;#39;s when you take a breath in and it&amp;#39;s seals now it&amp;#39;s filtering that air so n95s are very good for people who don&amp;#39;t want to get infection and don&amp;#39;t have respiratory issues because you&amp;#39;re now having to to breathe air in through a filter that takes a little bit more work if someone has COPD or you know or which is a obstructive lung disease or or other lung diseases that might not be the best thing to have in those situations so uh yeah I do wear a mask um I was very careful I know I was coming on your show this winter time and I was like there&amp;#39;s no way I want to get the flu miss and miss miss getting on uh to see you so yeah thank you for not for for avoiding bringing flu here it&amp;#39;s wild because ever since I started this podcast you know we put out now two episodes a week full length episodes on Mondays and these shorter essential episodes on Thursdays so uh I can&amp;#39;t afford to get sick yeah you know and I haven&amp;#39;t been sick in years I I I take care uh to not get sick but I&amp;#39;m going to think real carefully about this flu shot thing um what about handwashing is that so A Friend let me Let me Give a Little Bit of backstory uh the guy I worked for as a postto was an mdphd and he used to joke about the fact that handwashing did nothing because he was a in his prior life he was a a surgeon he did a I think he did rotation a surgery uh rotation he eventually became a neurologist okay then then a researcher um and I used to say what do you mean the handwashing does nothing and he&amp;#39;s like well have you ever seen what a physician does before surgery you know they wash up to their up to their basically their shoulders they um they&amp;#39;ve beta dine they glove in properly and you know that&amp;#39;s how you prevent infection washing your hands does nothing it&amp;#39;s a formality and I thought there&amp;#39;s no way that could be true then I started digging around in the literature about this yeah and it&amp;#39;s kind of mixed like so to what extent does washing our hands actually help us avoid getting infection I you know it&amp;#39;s a good question and I I think it probably comes down to some of the studies are probably not good data or or heterogenous enough to do a metaanalysis but what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really interesting is how many times a day if you were to watch yourself that you touch your nose you touch your face and these are the these are the portals for viruses to come into your body yeah eyes nose mouth that&amp;#39;s where they come and we we touch them all the time um you touch handles I mean if you think about it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost uh I don&amp;#39;t know creepy and flu it is creepy and flu and cold can survive out on surfaces for how long I I have to look up the numbers but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s longer than you might think I know that we when we looked at Co it it it&amp;#39;s that really we we I know we went crazy at the beginning of the co pandemic about wiping things down and really that&amp;#39;s not the way it seems to spread uh for Co and more Airborne things but for influenza droplets um that is uh you know Rota virus CI that&amp;#39;s a claustrum defal infection of the bowel that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the primary way that it actually spreads I&amp;#39;d like to take a quick break
