# [02:40:09] Nature vs Inside Environments, Dark Days/Bright Nights Problem

that&amp;#39;s interesting someone made the comment recently that so much of modern health or our attempts at um being healthier in modern times perhaps the better way to put it is about trying to bring the out ofd Dooors indoors you know we we exercise in gyms whereas we&amp;#39;re used to you know carry buckets of fruit and soil and you know uh we are talking about some artificial light um there&amp;#39;s no replacement but uh ways to supplement artificial light excuse me ways to supplement sunlight with artificial light you know we&amp;#39;re just indoors a lot more and uh no one&amp;#39;s suggesting that we all run around in loin claws outside all the time um but there really does seem to be many factors within outdoor environments so many both known and unknown seems that the reductionist approach to science while I you know I&amp;#39;ve made it my profession um for many decades is um it makes sense why no one thing seems to solve all the all the uh issues that we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re after that we need to experience these things in combination Maybe is just the best way to do that yeah and I I I can&amp;#39;t help but think of some studies that have been done in the past where this has really highlighted it um there was some evidence they believed that people with lung cancer would do better if they had they because they noticed that people with lung cancer did better when they had diets that were rich in vitamin E and vitamin A derivatives so they said oh reduction of science let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get vitamin E vitamin A let&amp;#39;s package it let&amp;#39;s give them to them in high doses maybe this will solve lung cancer or help lung cancer they have to stop the study early because they did worse than the control subjects important important to point that out yeah that the high dose supplementation is not the same as ingesting something in the context of of a food and we didn&amp;#39;t we didn&amp;#39;t discuss it uh directly but we kind of alluded to it with light and indoor light and artificial light so what do we get the human body since its existence has always had blue light in the presence of red light and altogether the entire biological Spectrum and now what we&amp;#39;ve done is we&amp;#39;ve essentially created an indoor environment where we have efficient lights which are supposed to be you know more efficient would imply that it&amp;#39;s equivalent But realize that led lights or the LED lights that are commercially available for us to buy are energy efficient because they&amp;#39;re no they&amp;#39;re not broadcasting if you will in the infrared or in the ultraviolet it&amp;#39;s a very specific narrow range of visible light we we alluded to this often times there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no red light in there either exactly they are really blue green yellow sometimes even UV light right I mean the fluorescent lights in a in a department store for instance or in a pharmacy I haven&amp;#39;t done the um spectral waveform analysis but you know those who have it&amp;#39;s published it&amp;#39;s out there there are a lot of data about environmental Occupational Health stuff um would show that it is the um the emission Spectra are severely tilted toward short wavelengths and there&amp;#39;s hardly any red light in there whereas a candle for instance or a fire roaring fire roaring candle people ask that sorry to interrupt is almost all orange and red light right and then people say well won&amp;#39;t that wake me up at night and a lot of people are surprised to know this I&amp;#39;ll just ask you and it&amp;#39;s not a it&amp;#39;s not a a trick question but how many looks do you think come from like a um a really bright candle or a roaring fireplace or the brightest Moon moonlit night on a full moon since you asked it that way I&amp;#39;m going to try to guess the other direction and say like 50 so somewhere between one and and 10 would be high level and then and then I started and I was like there&amp;#39;s no way that could be right you know how could it be it&amp;#39;s like this roaring fireplace or the the Moon that lights up so it turns out that if you&amp;#39;re at a at a campfire and we&amp;#39;re facing one another around the campfire I can see your face across the campfire I can see the front of your body and so there it looks like the it&amp;#39;s so bright must wake me up but no you have no trouble going back to your tent and falling asleep or your cabin if you turn away from that bright campfire you need a flashlight to navigate even the shortest distance which tells you that it&amp;#39;s not very bright at all it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very concentrated but the falloff of that brightness is is is really what indicates just how how dim it really is but if we think about an LED coming off a wall panel to adjust temperature in a hotel room uh it has something like 100 to 400 locks and and yet we think of it as a dim NightLight and so it&amp;#39;s it this is sneaky stuff yeah it&amp;#39;s really diabolical because that wall night light or uh thermostat light messes up our glucose regulation as shown in really good peer- reviewed studies absolutely and then the other aspect of it and I actually I think I learned this from you is that um the photo receptors are in the lower portion of our retina right or sorry the um yeah the lower portion of our retina and so this and so your the type of light that&amp;#39;s going to affect your circadian rhythm is going to be much more likely to do that if it&amp;#39;s coming from up above or you know at the same level than down below that&amp;#39;s right and the Scandinavians I have my stepmom a Scandinavian um understood this intuitively and so in the evening they don&amp;#39;t have ceiling light they turn off the ceiling lights and then they only use desk you know sort of table level um or even floor lights yeah now candles along the floor would be the ultimate but it&amp;#39;s super dangerous and we just had a bunch of fires here and those were outdoor Fires at first anyway but I and the reason we&amp;#39;re kind of um uh that we&amp;#39;re riffing in a kind of light bio uh uh you know improv here is that when you step back and you just look at it logically yeah we have dim days as you pointed out before we have bright evenings and and nights and it&amp;#39;s all short wavelength at night it&amp;#39;s terrible I I&amp;#39;m beginning to think that many many many of the problems that we have in terms of our metabolic Health sure it has to do with food certainly has to do with lack of exercise and a number of things screens Etc but I&amp;#39;m convinced that the light piece is at least one of the top three if not the top two major factors in determining the kind of obesity metabolic crisis I I completely agree with you the the one um thing I was going to add to that too are the windows so you you&amp;#39;re aware of course in in California we have um we need efficiency um and we have these windows called Low e glass and they&amp;#39;re specifically designed to filter out infrared light so the way you can tell whether or not your window is uh is filtering that out is just stand in it when the sun is on it if if there is a lot if you can feel the warmth of that sun then you know that it&amp;#39;s one of the old windows that&amp;#39;s allowing that to come in if you don&amp;#39;t feel it that&amp;#39;s a low E glass and so what we&amp;#39;ve done is we&amp;#39;ve created this environment inside there&amp;#39;s no the we&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of the incandescent bulbs we have LED bulbs we&amp;#39;ve gotten rid of the regular window it&amp;#39;s all for Energy Efficiency which is a a reasonable thing to do we need Energy Efficiency but but we no one&amp;#39;s no one&amp;#39;s asked what the human collateral damages to this type of of uh efficiency yeah and we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to take vacations to expensive sunny places to overcome this stuff that&amp;#39;s not the the right way to think about the way is to try and weave it into our lives low expense or no expense getting outside for instance opening Windows um in cars is the worst yeah so what&amp;#39;s Wild is if you go to the Pacific Northwest in the fall or winter when it&amp;#39;s really hard to get lighted you know I think Seattle&amp;#39;s the northernmost City in the contiguous us it&amp;#39;s so dark up there and you get into an Uber they have tinted windows it&amp;#39;s so crazy like it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s so wild especially since the research on this stuff is being pioneered largely out of the University of Washington in Seattle okay like we&amp;#39;ve got a number of things exactly backwards and and light in our relationship to light is one of the the ways in which we do the problem I think is when we start talking like this people think oh well we&amp;#39;re all supposed to have you know atriums and skylights and be outside all day it&amp;#39;s like yeah actually that would be great and dimmer and darker at night yes so taking small steps towards adjusting toward Bright Days yeah and very dim and Dark Nights is key we didn&amp;#39;t talk about incandescent bulbs it used to be until about 15 years ago that the quote unquote efficiency bulbs that were present in all our homes the the bulbs that would burn out pretty often were we know that the incandescent bulbs are more full spectrum yeah they have a lot of red and orange emission you see them as white or but they look a little warmer it has that warm those are great yeah um those are great they&amp;#39;re harder to find now actually they were illegal for a short while I don&amp;#39;t think anyone was going to come to your house and arrest you but you couldn&amp;#39;t get them they were banned and now they&amp;#39;re available again is my understanding oh I I haven&amp;#39;t seen them but um I know that in new constructions they&amp;#39;re not even putting in sockets they&amp;#39;re putting in receptacles that can only be replaced with other LEDs so in New in new constructions that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on um you know uh we&amp;#39;ll see what happens I I believe there is a movement right now based on the new Administration to see if we can change some of those rules and maybe uh get some rule changes I I believe it&amp;#39;s with the Department of energy so do you know who are really the smartest about this stuff that um if you want to know where human self-directed human health is going to be in 5 years you know where uh you know where you can look tell me you talk to the people who are really good at maintaining Aquaria and reptiles ah yes because those animals literally die under conditions of pure blue light like if you&amp;#39;ve ever had fish tanks I&amp;#39;m a fish like you don&amp;#39;t want to send me down this path but there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a very famous fish tank designer I was a huge fan of his unfortunately he died of pneumonia in uh at when he was 60 tekashi Mano um there&amp;#39;s museums in Japan about we developed this thing called aquascaping which is about plants and lighting more than the fish although there&amp;#39;s fish in it and everyone I&amp;#39;ve been involved in aquascaping in one level or another for a while now um super geeky I know but the whole principle is that you&amp;#39;re trying to create full spectrum light plants air you&amp;#39;re trying to create the right conditions for these fish and other um aquatic elements like plants to thrive and anyone that understands how to maintain reptiles or understands how which I&amp;#39;m not into I don&amp;#39;t like scaly things except fish um or Aquaria they know you can&amp;#39;t have a dir of long wavelength light or all the fish get sick the plants die they they just can&amp;#39;t do it now there are deep sea plants where the red light long wavelength light doesn&amp;#39;t get down to the bottom um and forgive me for for going off on this maybe I should just do a solo episode but you know what&amp;#39;s amazing is you know the intrinsically photosensitive cells of the eye that that set our Circ rhythms and that do all this the quote unquote reason um why the peak of the um portion of the V of the visible spectrum is where it is for those cells is because it&amp;#39;s the wavelength of light that can go deep into water if you&amp;#39;ve ever been snorkeling you only see Reds down to about 10 m or so you you swim down a little bit lower you need to bring a light with you right now of course the fish that are red are still red down there you just can&amp;#39;t see it because the lack of reflectance of light long wavelength light so yeah so we we are walking around in the evening basically um being exposed to what our eye and brain think is daytime just as our retinal sensitivity is going up oh and then all day we&amp;#39;re in this and it&amp;#39;s not bright enough right so anyway I&amp;#39;ll stop now but um it it has me activated as you can imagine because you hear about all the mental health issues the physical health issues yeah I think they&amp;#39;re all Downstream as you pointed out of M andrial dysfunction yeah put differently mitochondrial function is Downstream of proper relationship to light absolutely which you so beautifully Illustrated and I learned a ton that I hadn&amp;#39;t known before about that um okay if I continued on Aquaria we won&amp;#39;t get out we&amp;#39;ll be here this will be the longest podcast episode ever okay I&amp;#39;d love
