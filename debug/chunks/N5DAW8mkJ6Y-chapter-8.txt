# [00:43:32] Sunlight, Incidence of Influenza

sample pack in terms of your original question which is uh getting back to influenza or flu or things so there&amp;#39;s a St there&amp;#39;s a great study that I always love to talk about uh in terms of this and it was U actually done by Harvard it was a Harvard Kennedy School uh um which is not the medical school this is the public policy politics school and what they did was they looked at this very question of influenza and why do we always get it in the winter time and what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s potentially beneficial for it and the problem is is that we always have this influenza season which is in the wintertime we can talk about why that might be I would suggest to you that it&amp;#39;s because that&amp;#39;s when we have the shortest day of the year but we also have other things that happen at that time right what else is happening we&amp;#39;re having parties at that time there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s Thanksgiving there&amp;#39;s new years it&amp;#39;s cold you know does the does the temperature have anything to do with it uh we&amp;#39;re also inside because it&amp;#39;s cold so what is it that&amp;#39;s actually doing it well 2009 was a banner year because 2009 was the year that we had the H1N1 pandemic and that was a boon for us the reason is is because not because of the deaths that we had but from scientific standpoint this epidemic actually peaked in the summertime and it was in areas where the humidity was sometimes high and sometimes it was low and sometimes the temperature was high sometimes the temperature was low sometimes the sun was out sometimes it was cloudy in other words we uncoupled the influenza virus in 2009 from it being in the winter time and all of those things that were associated so now we have all of these data points and so Harvard went to work at looking at all these data points they looked at solar uh radiation data at that time and they were actually able to look specifically where that person came from and what was the solar radiation in that particular area and what they came up with was abs absolutely they said quote sunlight strongly protects against getting influenza it was a amazing study um I&amp;#39;m reminded of a study that was published in covid this was published in 2021 and it was looking at this very question is it temperature is it humidity or is it sunlight so what they did was they looked at the Autumn surge of covid in the winter time in Europe in Autumn actually and they asked this question when there was the surge date in this country whatever country it was in Europe when did it happen and what were the things that caused it to happen so they put all the data out there for temperature and it was a flatline there was temperature did not predict which country how the country got uh covid-19 when the surge started to happen they did the same thing for humidity Flatline when they got to Latitude it was a perfect correlation in other words as the sun in the wintertime started to peel back off of the Northern Hemisphere and started to sink below the equator and when there was a critical period of time that the day shortened to the point where at first Finland got a the shortest day or short enough day and then and then Germany and then further on what it showed was l ude actually perfectly predicted when the surge dates would happen starting off with Finland and ending up with Greece at the bottom wow do you see influenza at the equator you do see certainly influenza at the equator but what&amp;#39;s really interesting about that is that if you look at for instance uh the the influenza mortality in the United States obviously in the northern hemisphere what you will see is you will see it Peak generally one to three weeks after the shortest day of the year which is around now in in December and January now if you look at Australia what do you think you&amp;#39;d see the inverse exactly it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually in Australia the influenza season Peaks late June early July so if you now now go look at something like the Singapore Singapore is I think within 100 miles of the Equator you will see that in Singapore there are there is influenza Peaks and troughs but it&amp;#39;s not seasonal it&amp;#39;s just almost random is it not the case that um in hospitals and other um recovery Wards as it were uh that there used to be classically there was a uh a habit of putting people out into the sun like sun decks on the roof of hospitals and things of that sort I&amp;#39;m smiling because you you&amp;#39;re absolutely correct you&amp;#39;re absolutely correct and and as I started to go through this and look at this I started saying to myself we need to get people out in the sun and then I realized not only am I not the only one saying this but certainly this was being done 100 years ago 150 years ago just as
