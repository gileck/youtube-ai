# [02:52:38] Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Intermittent Fasting, Sunlight

I&amp;#39;d love to talk a little bit about two more things um we will return to New Start okay um but I want to know about long covid is long covid a real thing oh yeah and it uh what is long covid what can be done about long covid um how do you know if like like most people by now have had covid at a high level or low level yeah how do you know if you have long covid long covid is defined as having symptoms of of of a number of different types of symptoms typically it&amp;#39;s fatigue could be headaches could be all sorts of things um even loss of of uh taste and smell for more than 12 weeks after the infection so we&amp;#39;re talking a good three months the thing about long covid in my experience and what I&amp;#39;ve seen is that it&amp;#39;s very heterogeneous and it can be due to many different things so it&amp;#39;s been very difficult to put together exactly what the issue is but I&amp;#39;ll tell you one one uh as a as a physician as a pulmonologist one of the Cardinal symptoms of long covid is shortness of breath and so because because I&amp;#39;m a lung doctor and uh and people believe that shortness of breath always has to do with the lungs I get a lot of consults for people who have shortness of breath long covid after they were infected months ago and so a lot of these people came to me and one of the things I had to do is research this topic and um as as it turns out one of the not for everybody but for many people with long Co guess what&amp;#39;s at the center of long covid and actually we have research to show this mitochondrial dysfunction the thing that gets them covid is the thing that keeps them actually having long so there was a study that was done looking at metabolism and they showed it was uh one of these plots where they looked at up regulation and down regulation of metabolism in the mitochondria and uh they looked at the enzymes of glycolysis if you can remember back all those enzymes and they looked at the enzymes of beta oxidation so fatty acid basically oxidation and it was pretty well shown that there was a significant downregulation in people with long covid versus people who had covid that didn&amp;#39;t have long covid that had a downregulation in beta oxidation so they are they were not able to very well utilize and metabolize fatty acids in the mitochondria why is this the case well based on what we talked about earlier one of the certainly one of the the possibilities here is that they were infected with covid it downregulated for many of the systems in their body oxidative stress mechanisms caused damage to their mitochondria and we don&amp;#39;t know why but perhaps the areas of the mitochondria that were damaged most had to do with beta oxidation and fatty acid so you you&amp;#39;ll talk to people who have been infected with covid and they said we gain weight after after we infected with Co and I have all these symptoms first of all when when someone comes to you like that as a physician you have to make sure that you&amp;#39;re ruling out all of the obvious things so I&amp;#39;m getting an echocardiogram to make sure they didn&amp;#39;t have some sort of cardiac issue I&amp;#39;m getting pulmonary function tests to make sure they didn&amp;#39;t get scarring in their lungs and to you know have restrictive lung disease so I&amp;#39;m ruling out all of these things and so about a month or two later I&amp;#39;ve got all these tests back and I&amp;#39;m going over it and and for the ones where everything is negative CU there were some where I actually discovered they had clots and we had to treat them for that but for people who have everything negative and they&amp;#39;re still complain I remember one gentleman in particular he had eight out of 10 shortness of breath and uh he couldn&amp;#39;t sleep very well and this had been going on for over a year and we ruled out pulmonary embolism we ruled out congestive heart failure we ruled out interstitial lung disease with all of the tests and it was about this time that I was coming on to this idea about light and looking at these studies about the mitochondria and I had this idea because there was nothing else left um I had this idea that if there was some way we could regenerate the mitochondria but instead of it being damaged because you know when you have damaged mitochondria that that creates just more oxidative stress and damages it even more so in other words we have to basically get his body into a situation where he was generating new mitochondria so we could get rid of these issues with metabolism so I had this idea and I don&amp;#39;t know if it worked this way but I I actually got him to do intermittent fasting this whole idea about how intermittent fasting allows the body to generate things at night because you&amp;#39;re now the body knows what it needs to to down regulate and break up you just have to give it the opportunity this is how I understood it the innate immune system looking at pathological molecular patterns and also damaged molecular patterns so pamps and damps DP if we were to allow the immune system to do what it needs to do it would find these areas that are not working well tear them down destroy those cells and then allow regeneration of new cells with hopefully brand new virgin mitochondria so that was the first thing I did he vowed that he would never eat after 5:30 after I explained all this to him I took a clinic visit we explained all of this the other thing I did was told him to get out in the sun now this may sound you know dismissive can you imagine you&amp;#39;ve got long Co you&amp;#39;ve been suffering and you go to a physician and they tell you well I want you to stop eating after 5:30 I want you to get outside more like is he taking me seriously does he really believe that I have a condition but I took the time to explain why I was thinking about these things and going through the studies so he did it and I saw him back a month later he was he was amazed I was amazed he said that he um his gastrosoph reflex disease completely went away after he stopped eating after 5:30 his shortness of breath went from an 8 out of 10 to a 3 out of 10 and he said it doesn&amp;#39;t even bother him anymore this is after a year of having this type of of uh of symptoms so that really took me a pause now I&amp;#39;ll tell you the first thing that that doesn&amp;#39;t happen to all of my patients with long covid but it tells me that when you&amp;#39;re dealing with long covid you&amp;#39;re dealing with people who have had uh an infection that has caused damage to the system and some of the studies from what I reviewed sometimes people have residual virus still in the system there was a study that was done looking at to see whether vaccination of covid-19 would work after patients with with long covid there was some uh benefit it wasn&amp;#39;t big but it was some and it may it may be that you&amp;#39;re just stimulating the immune system again to fight off this res this this remaining virus that&amp;#39;s still in the system um but we have data that shows that the type of inflammation that we get with Spike protein is actually a toll-like receptor 4 type of inflammation there&amp;#39;s a study that looked at this and they were actually able to show and demonstrate that infrared light coming back to that again can actually mitigate the inflammation from tolik receptor uh mediated inflammation which is exactly the inflammation mediated in covid-19 so short answer to your question or that&amp;#39;s a long answer but the short answer is yes I do believe that long Co is is something and I believe people are suffering with it it&amp;#39;s a very heterogeneous um uh disease and it&amp;#39;s hard to just pin one thing on everything and and have it work for everything that being said I don&amp;#39;t see a lot of downside in instituting some of these things that we think may work sunlight as being one of those things uh people who are sick with uh covid and long Co tend to be sick and they stay indoors and so there may be an exacerbation of the process the last thing they want to do is to get outside um but it may actually be beneficial yeah I would imagine that
