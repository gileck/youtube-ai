# [01:22:16] Sleep \u0026 Darkness, Tools: Eye Mask, Bathroom Navigation; Meals \u0026 Light

beneficial I want to make sure that we talk about not just sunlight exposure and long wavelength light exposure from artificial sources but the flip side of all this which is is the importance of Darkness yeah at night um I&amp;#39;m aware of a study published in proing the National Academy of Sciences where they basically had kids sleep in either a completely black room or a room that had aund Lux this is very dim light folks 100 Luxe light source down in the corner kind of like a night light and then looked at morning glucose level blood glucose levels and there was a significant difference in the direction of you don&amp;#39;t want any light in the room that you&amp;#39;re sleeping now that&amp;#39;s hard to do especially if you&amp;#39;re you know if you&amp;#39;re traveling hotels but IM masks in particular um silk or even faux faux silk eye masks which are very comfortable um Can essentially provide that it&amp;#39;s very clear that it&amp;#39;s the light exposure to the eyes what if anything do you recommend for people who are basically living in an environment that&amp;#39;s too bright at night um you know do you yourself use like blackout curtains I mean what I mean how rigid I find that this is the one that&amp;#39;s a little bit harder for people um you have kids I mean what do you how do you how should we work with these data um and what what are your thoughts about the importance of getting things really dark at night yeah that that that is the same question and the same problem that I have with people that do night shift because they go home and they&amp;#39;re supposed to sleep and it&amp;#39;s bright it&amp;#39;s this daylight outside so what do you do um you know that&amp;#39;s where you get the aluminum foil around the Windows that&amp;#39;s where you you know you basically have to block out all of that light and then the eye patch of course is a nice thing to do as well um uh realizing though that um that even when you close your eyes if there&amp;#39;s a light source in the room people think well I&amp;#39;ll just close my eyes those those uh photons can go through the eyes just like we talked about with infrared light can go through the skin and and I don&amp;#39;t know if this is true or not but I&amp;#39;ve heard even one or two photons of light hitting the back of the retina can cause enough signal to go to the supermatic nucleus that shut down melatonin production or at least impair it in some way yeah in um experimental conditions that&amp;#39;s definitely true even um I mean the the sensitivity of the of the human visual system is extraordinary I mean your rods the more the higher sensitivity photo receptors in the back of your eye can can detect a single Photon yeah one Photon most people aren&amp;#39;t familiar with thinking in in photon quantities so um that might not mean anything to them put differently and this is these are wild data from Chuck cers Lab at Harvard uh Medical School light suppresses melatonin the question is how much light do you need because of the increase in sensitivity of the of the eye at night this rod rod system and these specializ cells that that send signals to the circadian clock 15 seconds 15 seconds of artificial light exposure will significantly quash your melatonin that&amp;#39;s a whiz at night 15 yeah right so if you go to the bathroom so then be say well what am I supposed to do how do I navigate at night and how do I make sure I&amp;#39;m peeing in the toilet especially for men right um and how do I not trip and fall this kind of and root to to the bathroom or getting a glass of water it&amp;#39;s actually you know it&amp;#39;s funny the answer turns out to be so logical but you almost have to hear it before it&amp;#39;s you kind of go oh that makes sense so perfectly fine to use your phone as a flashlight and then people say well flashlights really bright but yeah but you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not shining the light into your eyes so looking at your screen limed way down in the middle middle of the night is going to be very detrimental to the Melatonin system right at the time where you want melatonin high and other things too yeah but looking at a flashlight shown into the you know the hallway so you can navigate right very different scenario than it shining directly into your eyes so you can um and then there are a number of different red light sources that are that are pretty good like little red light lamps that are effective and or you can just turn your phone to uh red light mode there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a a way to do that well I remember a podcast that you had probably a couple of years ago where you had someone I forgot his name but he he he said his his uh house is very dark at night and people would be afraid to go over because tripping all that&amp;#39;s my good friend Dr Samar herar now keep in mind that Samar is the head of the chronobiology unit the National Institutes of mental health so he like literally lives and breathes this stuff right the other thing about Samar which is interesting is when I first met Samar um he was very very overweight what samur may have relayed on that podcast um perhaps not is that by changing his relationship to light sunlight and in getting sunlight during the day and darkness at night and by the way he lived in Baltimore at that time so it&amp;#39;s not trivial to do that and changing his sleep schedule to one of getting into bed around 9 or 10 p.m. and waking up earlier as opposed to staying up late and sleeping the equivalent amount into later in the morning yeah he lost over 80 pounds wow effortlessly his appetite just adjusted because he finally got in tune with his natural circadian cycles and and Glen jeffy&amp;#39;s work has made me think in my mind because of the presence of light in that study and the fact that the glucose was less it makes me wonder whether or not we really shouldn&amp;#39;t be eating only when the Sun is up I agree that we probably should only be eating when the Sun is up I myself I like dinner somewhere around 6 6:30 it&amp;#39;s tough for me um but but I totally agree if people would if people were willing to meet me for dinner earlier I&amp;#39;m good now it is true that sleep is vast improved when you haven&amp;#39;t eaten in the previous couple of hours it&amp;#39;s also true that trying to fall asleep and stay asleep when you have gnawing hunger in your belly is not easy okay yeah and I I would say the other thing is too is uh making sure that these rules that we&amp;#39;re coming up with here based on physiology aren&amp;#39;t laws so so that we get so anxious about following them that they actually become a detriment there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a point where we just have to do well enough and then move on to to the you know to the next we try to do it the next day we&amp;#39;re human yeah I want to talk about the
